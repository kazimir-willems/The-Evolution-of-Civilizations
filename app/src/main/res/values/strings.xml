    <string name="about_text">The content of this app, \"The Evolution of Civilisations: An Introduction to Historical Analysis\" is written by Carroll Quigley. Carroll Quigley (1910-1977) taught the History of Civilization at Georgetown School of Foreign Service for more than thirty years. A graduate of Harvard University he first taught history there and at Princeton. Professor Quigley was regarded as an expert on the comparative history of civilizations, twentieth century Europe and African Affairs. He served as a consultant to the Smithonian Institution and as a member of the editorial board of Current History. He was a fellow of the American Anthropological Association, a member of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations, and a life member (London) of the English-Speaking Union of the Commonwealth. He contributed numerous articles to scholarly publications and was also the Author of \"Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time\".</string>

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Evolution of Civilizations expresses two dimensions of its author,
            Carroll
            Quigley, that most extraordinary historian, philosopher, and teacher. In the first
            place, its scope is wide-ranging, covering the whole of man\'s activities throughout
            time. Second, it is analytic, not merely descriptive. It attempts a categorization of
            man\'s activities in sequential fashion so as to provide a causal explanation of the
            stages of civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley coupled enormous capacity for work with a peculiarly
            \"scientific\" approach. He
            believed that it should be possible to examine the data and draw conclusions. As a boy
            at the Boston Latin School, his academic interests were mathematics, physics, and
            chemistry. Yet during his senior year he was also associate editor of the Register, the
            oldest high school paper in the country. His articles were singled out for national
            awards by a national committee headed by George Gallup.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At Harvard, biochemistry was to be his major. But Harvard, expressing
            then
            a belief
            regarding a well-rounded education to which it has now returned, required a core
            curriculum including a course in the humanities. Quigley chose a history course,
            \"Europe Since the Fall of Rome.\" Always a contrary man, he was graded at the top of
            his class in
            physics and calculus and drew a C in the history course. But the development of ideas
            began to assert its fascination for him, so he elected to major in history. He graduated
            magna cum laude as the top history student in his class.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley was always impatient. He stood for his doctorate oral
            examination
            at the end
            of his second year of graduate studies. Charles Howard McIlwain, chairman of the
            examining board, was very impressed by Quigley\'s answer to his opening question; the
            answer included a long quotation in Latin from Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln in
            the thirteenth century. Professor Mcllwain sent Quigley to Princeton University as a
            graduate student instructor.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the spring of 1937 I was a student in my senior year at Princeton.
            Quigley was my
            preceptor in medieval history. He was Boston Irish; I was New York Irish. Both of us,
            Catholics adventuring in a strangely Protestant establishment world, were fascinated by
            the Western intellectual tradition anchored in Augustine, Abelard, and Aquinas that
            seemed to have so much more richness and depth than contemporary liberalism. We became
            very close in a treasured friendship that was terminated only by his death.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the course of rereading The Evolution of Civilizations I was
            reminded
            of the
            intensity of our dialogue. In Quigley\'s view, which I shared, our age was one of
            irrationality. That spring we talked about what career decisions I should make. At his
            urging I applied to and was admitted by the Harvard Graduate School in History. But I
            had reservations about an academic career in the study of the history that I loved, on
            the ground that on Quigley\'s own analysis the social decisions of importance in our
            lifetime would be made in ad hoc irrational fashion in the street. On that reasoning,
            finally I transferred to law school.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Princeton, Carroll Quigley met and married Lillian Fox. They spent
            their honeymoon
            in Paris and Italy on a fellowship to write his doctoral dissertation, a study of the
            public administration of the Kingdom of Italy, 1805-14. The development of the state in
            western Europe over the last thousand years always fascinated Quigley. He regarded the
            development of public administration in the Napoleonic states as a major step in the
            evolution of the modern state. It always frustrated him that each nation, including our
            own, regards its own history as unique and the history of other nations as irrelevant to
            it.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In 1938-41, Quigley served a stint at Harvard, tutoring graduate
            students
            in ancient
            and medieval history. It offered little opportunity for the development of cosmic views
            and he was less than completely content there. It was, however, a happy experience for
            me. I had entered Harvard Law School. We began the practice of having breakfast together
            at Carroll and Lillian\'s apartment.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In 1941 Quigley accepted a teaching appointment at Georgetown\'s
            School of
            Foreign
            Service. It was to engage his primary energies throughout the rest of his busy life.
            There he became an almost legendary teacher. He chose to teach a course, \"The
            Development of Civilization,\" required of the incoming class, and that course
            ultimately
            provided the structure and substance for The Evolution of Civilizations. As a course in
            his hands, it was a vital intellectual experience for young students, a mind-opening
            adventure. Foreign Service School graduates, meeting years later in careers around the
            world, would establish rapport with each other by describing their experience in his
            class. It was an intellectual initiation with remembered impact that could be shared by
            people who had graduated years apart.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The fortunes of life brought us together again. During World War II I
            served as a very
            junior officer on Admiral King\'s staff in Washington. Carroll and I saw each other
            frequently. Twenty years later, after practicing law in Oregon, I came into the
            government with President Kennedy. Our eldest daughter became a student under Carroll at
            Georgetown University. We bought a house close by Carroll and Lillian. I had Sunday
            breakfast with them for years and renewed our discussions of the affairs of a
            disintegrating world.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Superb teacher Quigley was, and could justify a lifetime of prodigious
            work on that
            success alone. But ultimately he was more. To me he was a figure—he would scoff at this—
            like Augustine, Abelard, and Aquinas, searching for the truth through examination of
            ultimate reality as it was revealed in history. Long ago, he left the church in the
            formal sense. Spiritually and intellectually he never left it. He never swerved from his
            search for the meaning of life. He never placed any goal in higher priority. If the God
            of the Western civilization that Quigley spent so many years studying does exist in the
            terms that he saw ascribed to him by our civilization, that God will now have welcomed
            Quigley as one who has pleased him.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In an age characterized by violence, extraordinary personal
            alienation,
            and the
            disintegration of family, church, and community, Quigley chose a life dedicated to
            rationality. He addressed the problem of explaining change in the world around us, first
            examined by Heraclitus in ancient Greece. Beneath that constant change, so apparent and
            itself so real, what is permanent and unchanging?
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley wanted an explanation that in its very categorization would
            give
            meaning to a
            history which was a record of constant change. Therefore the analysis had to include but
            not be limited to categories of subject areas of human activity—military, political,
            economic, social, religious, intellectual. It had to describe change in categories
            expressed sequentially in time—mixture, gestation, expansion, conflict, universal
            empire, decay, invasion. It was a most ambitious effort to make history rationally
            understandable. F. E. Manuel, in his review of this book for the American Historical
            Review, following its first publication in 1961, described it as on \"sounder ground\"
            than the work of Toynbee.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley found the explanation of disintegration in the gradual
            transformation of
            social \"instruments\" into \"institutions,\" that is, the transformation of social
            arrangements functioning to meet real social needs into social institutions serving
            their own purposes regardless of real social needs. In an ideologically Platonistic
            society, social arrangements are molded to express a rigidly idealized version of
            reality. Such institutionalization would not have the flexibility to accommodate to the
            pressures of changing reality for which the ideology has no categories of thought that
            will allow perception, analysis, and handling. But the extraordinary distinction of
            Western civilization is that its ontology allows an open-ended epistemology. It is
            engaged in a constant effort to understand reality which is perceived as in constant
            change. Therefore, our categories of knowledge are themselves always subject to change.
            As a consequence reform is always possible.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The question today is whether we have lost that Western view of
            reality
            which has
            given our 2,000 years of history its unique vitality, constantly pregnant with new
            versions of social structure. In Evolution, Quigley describes the basic ideology of
            Western civilization as expressed in the statement, \"The truth unfolds in time through
            a
            communal process.\" Therefore, Quigley saw the triumph in the thirteenth century of the
            moderate realism of Aquinas over dualistic exaggerated realism derived from Platonism as
            the major epistemologic triumph that opened up Western civilization. People must
            constantly search for the \"truth\" by building upon what others have learned. But no
            knowledge can be assumed to be complete and final. It could be contradicted by new
            information received tomorrow. In epistemology, Quigley always retained his belief in
            the scientific method. Therefore, he saw Hegel and Marx as presumptuous, in error, and
            outside the Western tradition in their analysis of history as an ideologic dialectic
            culminating in the present or immediate future in a homeostatic condition.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley comments upon the constant repetition of conflict and
            expansion
            stages in
            Western history. That reform process owes its possibility to the uniquely Western belief
            that truth is continually unfolding. Therefore Western civilization is capable of
            re-examining its direction and its institutions, and changing both as appears necessary.
            So in Western history, there was a succession of technological breakthroughs in
            agricultural practice and in commerce. Outmoded institutions like feudalism and—in the
            commercial area—municipal mercantilism in the period 1270- 1440, and state mercantilism
            in the period 1690-1810 were discarded. Similarly, we may also survive the economic
            crisis described by Quigley as monopoly capitalism in the present post-1900 period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Yet Quigley perceives—correctly in my view—the possible termination of
            open-ended
            Western civilization. With access to an explosive technology that can tear the planet
            apart, coupled with the failure of Western civilization to establish any viable system
            of world government, local political authority will tend to become violent and
            absolutist. As we move into irrational activism, states will seize upon ideologies that
            justify absolutism. The 2,000-year separation in Western history of state and society
            would then end. Western people would rejoin those of the rest of the world in merging
            the two into a single entity, authoritarian and static. The age that we are about to
            enter would be an ideologic one consistent with the views of Hegel and Marx—a
            homeostatic condition. That triumph would end the Western experiment and return us to
            the experience of the rest of the world—namely, that history is a sequence of stages in
            the rise and fall of absolutist ideologies.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;America is now in a crisis-disintegrating stage. In such a condition,
            absent a
            philosophy, people turn readily to charismatic personalities. So at the beginning of our
            time of troubles, in the depression of the 1930s, we turned to Franklin D. Roosevelt. He
            took us through the depression and World War II. We were buoyed by his optimism and
            reassured by the strength and confidence of his personality. Within the Western
            tradition he provided us with no solutions; he simply preserved options. When he died,
            all America was in shock. We had lost our shield. Carroll came over to my place that
            night. We talked in the subdued fashion of a generation that had lost its guardian and
            would now have to face a hostile world on its own.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since then we in America have been denied the easy-out of charismatic
            leadership. It
            may just be that we shall have to follow the route that Quigley has marked out for us in
            this book. We may have to look at our history, analyze it, establish an identity in that
            analysis, and make another try at understanding reality in a fashion consistent with
            that open-ended tradition.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If so, America, acting for Western civilization, must find within the
            history of that
            civilization the intellectual and spiritual reserves to renew itself within the
            tradition. Striking as was the impact of this book at the time of its first publication,
            in 1961, its major impact will be in support of that effort in the future. There is hope
            that in Western civilization the future ideology will be rational. If so, it would be
            consistent with an epistemology that accepts the general validity of sensory experience
            and the possibility of making generalizations from that experience, subject to
            modification as additional facts are perceived. It is that epistemology which was termed
            moderate realism in the thirteenth century and, in its epistemologic aspects, is now
            known as the scientific method. Such a rational ideology is probable only if it is
            developed out of the special history of the West. As appreciation of that spreads, the
            kind of analysis that Carroll Quigley develops in this book is the analysis that the
            West must use.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Such an effort would be consistent in social terms with Quigley\'s
            view of
            his own
            life. He greatly admired his mother, a housewife, and his father, a Boston firechief,
            and described them as teaching him to do his best at whatever he chose to put his
            energies. That was their way of saying what Carroll would have described as man\'s
            responsibility to understand and relate actively to a continually unfolding reality. He
            dedicated his life to that purpose.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This book is not a history. Rather it is an attempt to establish
            analytical tools that
            will assist the understanding of history. Most historians will regard such an effort as
            unnecessary or even impossible. Some answer must be made to these two objections.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Those who claim that no analytical tools are needed in order to write
            history are
            naive. To them the facts of history are relatively few and are simply arranged. The
            historian\'s task is merely to find these facts; their arrangement will be obvious. But
            it should require only a moment\'s thought to recognize that the facts of the past are
            infinite, and the possible arrangements of any selection from these facts are equally
            numerous. Since all the facts cannot be mobilized in any written history because of
            their great number, there must be some principle on which selection from these facts is
            based. Such a principle is a tool of historical analysis. Any sophisticated historian
            should be aware of the principles he uses and should be explicit to his readers about
            these. After all, any past event, even the writing of this book, is a fact of history,
            but most such facts, including this book, do not deserve to be mentioned in the
            narration of history.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If historians are not explicit, at least to themselves, about their
            principles of
            selection among the facts of the past and among the many possible arrangements of these
            facts, all histories will be simply accidental compilations that cannot be justified in
            any rational way. Historians will continue to write about some of the events of history
            while neglecting others equally significant or even more significant, and they will form
            patterns for these facts along lines determined by traditional (and basically
            accidental) lines or in reflection of old controversies about the patterns of these
            facts.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This, indeed, is pretty much what we have in history today. In
            American
            history, for
            example, dozens of books examine and re-examine the same old issues without, in most
            cases, contributing much that is new or different. The central fact of American history
            is the process by which a society with European cultural patterns was modified by the
            selective process of emigration from Europe and the opportunity to exploit the enormous,
            largely virgin, resources of the New World. Yet in most histories of the United States,
            this subject is hardly mentioned. Instead we have volume after volume of discussion on
            the rivalry of Jeffersonians and Hamiltonians or on the unrealistic problem whether the
            American Civil War was a repressible or an irrepressible conflict or on whether the
            American lapse into isolationism after World War I was caused more by the vindictiveness
            of Lodge or the inflexibility of Wilson.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;To the non-American world the central fact of American history is
            American
            technology—what they used to call \"Fordism,\" meaning mass production. Until very
            recently there was no history of American technology in existence, and even today this
            vital subject obtains only incidental mention, with an almost total lack of real
            understanding, in most histories of the United States.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As we have said, the content of most books depends upon accidental
            factors
            or, at
            most, on the rehash of ancient controversies. The Civil War has commanded major
            attention, but there is little recognition of the real significance of this war; namely,
            that after giving an impetus to industrialization, it left a residue of emotional
            patterns that alienated the farmers of the South and the farmers of the West so that the
            country could be dominated politically by the high finance and heavy industry of the
            East. This situation, which forms the essential background for such familiar phenomena
            as the agrarian discontent and third-party movements of the period 1873-1933, as well as
            the attacks on political machines and the rise of civil service, or the growth of
            muckraking or progressivism, and of government regulation of business, is rarely
            presented in adequate fashion as the background that it is. Instead these events are
            mentioned as if they were merely accidental occurrences related in some obscure fashion
            to the idiosyncrasies of Americans. And the average college student of American history
            finishes his study without any idea why the Republican party became the party of big
            business in 1892-1932, what the Whitneys contributed to American life, or the
            significant contributions of Joseph Henry or Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903) to the
            world today.

            and
            stale
            controversy continue to determine the centers of attention. The Battle of Gettysburg has
            been fought and refought (with four major books in the last six months), just as if the
            South ever really had a chance of winning the war, in this or any other battle, while
            the Battle of Petersburg, which is of far greater tactical significance (since it was a
            direct foretaste of 1914-18), is almost totally neglected.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Matters are no better in European history. To mention only one point,
            in
            which I am
            personally very interested, the one dominant central fact of European history over the
            last thousand years has been the almost steady growth of public authority and the public
            services. We could never guess this from the history books. Or again, reams have been
            written on the French Revolution and its origins, yet some of the most vital points are
            hardly mentioned. We have been told repeatedly that the government of the Old Regime was
            \"absolute\" and that the Revolution began because this regime was financially
            \"bankrupt.\"
            Few have seen the paradox lying in a situation where an \"absolute state\" could not tax
            its subjects. A colleague on the faculty at Princeton once stated in conversation as a
            fact that the Revolution occurred in France because that country was the most advanced
            in Europe. When I replied that, in my opinion, the Revolution came in France because the
            French government was one of the most backward in Europe, he was astonished. I am not
            trying here to consider this problem; I am simply trying to point out that this is a
            problem that certainly should have been examined in connection with the study of the
            French Revolution and that just as surely would have been discussed in any historical
            work based on rational tools of historical analysis. Because such tools have not been
            used, study of the French Revolution, like the study of other matters, has concentrated
            its attention on those aspects of the problem that came to be discussed largely for
            traditional and accidental reasons. In fact, the chief force directing the
            historiography of the French Revolution has not been a determined effort to find what
            happened but rather has been the party conflicts of the Third French Republic. Once
            these partisan motivations are rejected, a history of the French Revolution could be
            written that, with equal justification, would have discussed quite different aspects of
            the subject. Without principles of selection among the facts and theories, one selection
            is as well justified as another on any grounds outside tradition.

            are
            unnecessary.
            To the much smaller group of historians who say that such tools are impossible to
            obtain, I can only offer this book as an attempt. This group of critics is much more
            difficult to deal with. They are skeptics sophisticated enough to recognize that there
            is a problem, but not consistent enough to cease being historians when they insist that
            there is no solution. The only justification they can offer is to fall back on tradition
            once again. These skeptics recognize the infinity of past facts and the subjectivity of
            the criteria usually used in making a selection from these facts, but they are content
            to continue to work with the traditionally acceptable selections from both. I offer them
            here principles of selection based on the methods used in science, but I recognize the
            difficulty of the problem of persuading them that I have anything helpful. As skeptics
            these people are almost impervious to persuasion.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;During the summer that I was twelve years old, I walked four or five
            times
            a week to
            fish from Hingham Bridge. The distance was about five miles, part of it along a high
            railroad embankment that had been ballasted with crushed quartz. In this ballast were
            hundreds of quartz crystals. Each day I stopped awhile to look for a perfect crystal. I
            found some excellent ones, but never one that could be called perfect. The books I
            consulted told me that a quartz crystal should be a hexagonal prism with a regular
            hexagonal pyramid at the end. The ones I found were invariably irregular in some way,
            with sides of varying sizes, frequently with several crystals jammed together so that,
            in seeking to share the same material, they mutually distorted each other\'s hexagonal
            regularity.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;After several weeks of casual searching, I found three or four
            crystals
            that were
            almost perfect, at least at the pyramidal end. But to find these, I had examined and
            discarded hundreds of distorted crystals. By what right, I asked, did the books say that
            quartz crystals occurred in regular pyramidal hexagonal prisms when only a small
            percentage of those found had such a shape? Obviously, the books meant that crystallized
            quartz has a tendency to take hexagonal form and will do so unless distorted by outside
            forces. The fact that ninety-nine percent are distorted does not deter the scientist
            from forming in his mind an idealized picture of an undistorted crystal, or from
            stating, in books, that quartz crystals occur in that idealized form.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Later, when I studied science in school and college, I found that most
            scientific
            \"laws\" were of this idealized character. They were not statements of what actually
            happens in the world or of what we observe through our senses, but rather were highly
            idealized and much oversimplified relationships that might occur if a great many other
            influences, which were always present, were neglected. I found that the most highly
            praised \"scientific laws\" attributed to great men like Galileo or Newton were of this
            character. It was a blow to discover that Newton\'s laws of planetary motion did not, in
            fact, describe the movements of the sun\'s satellites as we observe them, except in a
            very approximate way. In some cases, notably that of the planet Mercury, the
            approximation was by no means close.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Still later, when my interests shifted from the physical sciences to
            the
            social
            sciences, and I worked with students of human society who were generally lacking in any
            close familiarity with the natural sciences, I found a curious situation. The social
            scientists usually had erroneous ideas about the methods and theories of natural
            science, believing them to be rigid, exact, and invariable. Accordingly, they felt that
            these methods were not applicable to the social sciences. Thus I found that natural
            scientists were quite prepared to accept as a \"law\" a rule that was only approximately
            true or was true in only one case in a hundred, while the social scientists were
            reluctant to accept any rule that was only approximate or even one that had no more than
            one exception in a hundred cases.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;After years of work in both areas of study, I concluded that the
            social
            sciences were
            different, in many important ways, from the natural sciences, but that the same
            scientific methods were applicable in both areas, and, indeed, that no very useful work
            could be done in either area except by scientific methods. In both areas the laws
            arising from the use of scientific methods will be idealized theories reflecting
            observed phenomena only approximately, but these theories must be based on our
            observations; and any wide failure of approximation or any totally inapplicable cases
            must either be explained in terms of unconsidered outside factors, or the theories
            themselves must be changed to cover such variant observations. The \"laws\" of
            historical
            change described in this book seem to me to fit the observed cases at least as closely
            as most of the theories of natural science. Most of the laws I shall mention apply,
            without exception, or with only slight, explicable divergencies, to all the cases I
            know. They are then, it would seem to me, as worthy of consideration as the scientific
            laws on the formation of crystals.

    <array name="content_1_2_1">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Before proceeding to examine any theories of historical change, we
            should
            review what
            we understand by the term \"scientific method.\" In general, this method has three parts
            which we might call (1) gathering evidence, (2) making a hypothesis, and (3) testing the
            hypothesis. The first of these, \"gathering evidence,\" refers to collecting all the
            observations relevant to the topic being studied. The important point here is that we
            must have all the evidence, for, obviously, omission of a few observations, or even one
            vital case, might make a considerable change in our final conclusions. It is equally
            obvious, I hope, that we cannot judge that we have all the evidence or cannot know what
            observations are relevant to our subject unless we already have some kind of tentative
            hypothesis or theory about the nature of that subject. In most cases a worker does have
            some such preliminary theory. This leads to two warnings. In the first place, the three
            parts of scientific methodology listed above were listed in order, not because a
            scientist performs them separately in sequence, but simply because we must discuss them
            in an orderly fashion. And, in the second place, any theories, even those regarded as
            final conclusions at the end of all three parts of scientific method, remain tentative.
            As scientific methodology is practiced, all three parts are used together at all stages,
            and therefore no theory, however rigorously tested, is ever final, but remains at all
            times tentative, subject to new observation and continued testing by such observation.
            No scientist ever believes that he has the final answer or the ultimate truth on
            anything. Rather he feels that science advances by a series of successive (and, he
            hopes, closer) approximations to the truth; and, since the truth is never finally
            reached, the work of scientists must indefinitely continue. Science, as one writer put
            it, is like a single light in darkness; as it grows brighter its shows more clearly the
            area of illumination and, simultaneously, lengthens the circle of surrounding darkness.

    <array name="content_1_2_2">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Having gathered all the \"relevant\" evidence, the scientist may
            proceed
            to
            the second
            part of scientific methodology, making a hypothesis. In doing this, two rules must be
            followed: (a) the hypothesis must explain all the observations and (b) the hypothesis
            must be the simplest one that will explain them. These two rules might be summed up in
            the statement that a scientific hypothesis must be adequate and it must be simple. Once
            again let us confess that these two rules are idealistic rather than practicable, but
            they remain, nevertheless, the goals by which a scientist guides his activities.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that a hypothesis must be adequate, and thus must include
            all
            of the
            relevant observations, we are saying something simple. But carrying out this simple
            admonition is extremely difficult. It is quite true that every scientific hypothesis
            suffers from inadequate evidence—that is, it does not include in its explanation all the
            relevant evidence, and would be different if it did so. It is not easy to tear any event
            out of the context of the universe in which it occurred without detaching it from some
            factor that has influenced it. This is difficult enough in the physical sciences. It is
            immensely more difficult in the social sciences. It is likely that in any society the
            factors influencing an event are so numerous that any effort to detach an event from its
            social context must inevitably do violence to it. The extreme specialization of most
            social studies today, concentrating attention on narrow fields and brief periods, is a
            great hindrance to our understanding of such special fields, although the fact is not so
            widely recognized as it should be, since any specialist\'s work is usually examined only
            by his fellow specialists who have the same biases and blind spots as he does himself.
            But a specialist from one area of study who examines the work being done in some other
            area cannot fail to notice how the overspecialized training of the experts in his new
            area of interest has handicapped their understanding of that area.

    <array name="content_1_2_3">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The second requirement of a scientific hypothesis—that it should be
            simple—is also
            more difficult to carry out in practice than it is to write down in words. Essentially,
            it means that a hypothesis should explain the existing observations by making the fewest
            assumptions and by inferring the simplest relationships. This is so vital that a
            hypothesis is scientific or fails to be scientific on this point alone. Yet in spite of
            its importance, this requirement of scientific method is frequently not recognized to be
            important by many active scientists. The requirement that a scientific hypothesis must
            be \"simple\" or, as it is sometimes expressed, \"economical\" does not arise merely
            from a
            scientist\'s desire to be simple. Nor does it arise from some esthetic urge, although
            this is not so remote from the problem as might seem at first glance. When a
            mathematician says of a mathematical demonstration that it is \"beautiful,\" he means
            exactly what the word \"beautiful\" means to the rest of us, and this same element is
            undoubtedly significant in the formulation of theory by a scientist as well.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The rule of simplicity or economy in scientific hypothesis has a
            number of
            corollaries. One of these, called \"the uniformity of nature,\" assumes that the whole
            universe is made of the same substances and obeys the same laws and, accordingly, will
            behave in the same way under the same conditions. Such an assumption does not have to be
            proved —indeed, it could not be proved. It is made for two reasons. First, because it is
            simpler to assume that things are the same than it is to assume that they are different.
            And, second, while we cannot prove this assumption to be correct even if it is correct,
            we can, if it is not correct, show this by finding a single exceptional case. We could
            demonstrate the uniformity of nature only by comparing all parts of the universe with
            all other parts, something that clearly could never be achieved. But we can assume this,
            because it is a simpler hypothesis than its contrary; and, if it is wrong, we can show
            this error by producing one case of a substance or a physical law that is different in
            one place or time from other places or times. To speak briefly, we might say that
            scientific assumptions cannot be proved but they can be refuted, and they must always be
            put in a form that will allow such refutation.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Other examples or applications of the rule of uniformity of nature
            would
            be the
            scientific assumptions that \"man is part of nature\" or that \"all men have the same
            potentialities.\" Neither of these could be proved, because this would involve the
            impossible task of comparing all men with one another (including both past and future
            men) and with nonhuman nature, but these assumptions can be made under the rule of
            simplicity of scientific hypothesis or its corollary, the rule of the uniformity of
            nature. Thus they do not require proof. But, on the other hand, if these assumptions are
            not correct, they could be disproved by one, or a few clear-cut cases of exceptions to
            the rule.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus, in the final analysis, these rules about scientific hypotheses
            are
            not derived
            from any sense of economy or of esthetics, but rather arise from the nature of
            demonstration and proof. The familiar judicial rule that a man is to be assumed innocent
            until he has been proved guilty is based on the same fundamental principles as these
            rules about scientific hypotheses, and, like these, rests ultimately on the nature of
            proof. We must assume that a man is innocent (not guilty) until we have proof of his
            guilt because it is always simpler to assume that things are not so than to assume that
            they are, and also because no man can prove the negative \"not guilty\" except by the
            impossible procedure of producing proof of innocence during every moment of his past
            life. (If he omits a moment, the charge of guilt could then be focused on the period for
            which proof of innocence is unobtainable.) But by making the general and negative
            assumption of innocence for all men, we can disprove this for any single man by the much
            easier procedure of producing evidence of guilt for a single time, place, and deed.
            Since it is true that a general negative cannot be demonstrated, we are entitled to make
            that general negative assumption under the rule of the simplicity of scientific
            hypothesis, and to demand refutation of such an assumption by specific positive proof.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A familiar example of this method could be seen in the fact that we
            cannot
            be required
            to prove that ghosts and sea serpents and clairvoyance do not exist. Scientifically we
            assume that these things do not exist, and require no evidence to justify this
            assumption, while the burden of producing proofs must fall on anyone who says that such
            things do exist.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The rule of simplicity in scientific hypotheses is by no means
            something
            new. First
            formulated in the late Middle Ages, it was known as \"Occam\'s razor\" and was applied
            chiefly to logic. Later it was applied to the natural sciences. Most persons believe
            that Galileo and his contemporaries made their great contributions to science by
            refuting Aristotle. This \"refutation of Aristotle,\" or, more correctly, \"refutation
            of
            Plato and of the Pythagorean rationalists,\" was only incidental to the much more
            significant achievement of making the commonly accepted rules about the universe more
            scientific by applying to them Occam\'s razor. This was done by assuming that the
            heavenly bodies and terrestrial objects operate under the same laws (laws that were
            later enunciated by Newton). This application of Occam\'s razor to natural phenomena was
            a major step forward in making the study of nature scientific. Application of this rule
            to the social sciences (that is, to phenomena involving subjective factors) still
            remains to be done, and would provide a similar impetus to the advance of this area of
            human thinking. It has already been done in judicial procedure (by such rules as the
            assumption of innocence and the needlessness of proving negatives), and the chief task
            in American law at the present time is to protect and, if necessary, extend the
            application of Occam\'s razor to judicial procedure. Many persons in recent years have
            felt uncomfortable over the demand that certain persons should \"prove\" that they are
            not
            \"communists,\" but few realized that the unfairness of such a demand rests on the
            nature
            of scientific assumption and the nature of proof and, above all, on the violation of
            Occam\'s razor.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These rules about the nature of scientific hypothesis are so important
            that science
            would perish if they were not observed. This has already happened in the past. During
            the period 600-400 B.C. in the Greek-speaking world, the Ionian scientists applied these
            rules about scientific hypothesis by assuming that the heavens and the earth were made
            of the same substance and obeyed the same laws and that man was part of nature. The
            enemies of science about the year 400 B.C. made assumptions quite different from those
            of the Ionians; namely, that the heavens were made of a substance different from those
            on earth and, accordingly, obeyed different laws, and, furthermore, that man was not
            part of nature (since he was a spiritual being). They accepted the older idea that the
            earth was made up of four elements (earth, water, air, fire), but assumed that the
            heavens were made of a quite different fifth element, quintessence. They admitted that
            the earth was changeable but insisted that the celestial areas were rigidly unchanging.
            They claimed that the laws of motion in the two were quite different, objects on the
            earth moving naturally in straight lines at decreasing velocity to their natural
            condition of rest, while objects in the heavens moved in perfect circles at constant
            speed as their natural condition. These nonscientific assumptions, made about 400 B.C.
            without proof and by violating the fundamental rules of scientific method, set up a
            nonscientific world view which could not be disproved. The Pythagorean rationalists were
            able to do this and to destroy science because the scientists of that day, like many
            scientists of today, had no clear idea of scientific method and were therefore in no
            position to defend it. Even today few scientists and perhaps even fewer nonscientists
            realize that science is a method and nothing else. Even in books pretending to be
            authoritative, we are told that science is a body of knowledge or that science is
            certain areas of study. It is neither of these. Science clearly could be a body of
            knowledge only if we were willing to use the name for something that is constantly
            changing. From week to week, even from day to day, the body of knowledge to which we
            attribute the name science is changing, the beliefs of one day being, sooner or later,
            abandoned for quite different beliefs.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Closely related to the erroneous idea that science is a body of
            knowledge
            is the
            equally erroneous idea that scientific theories are true. One example of this belief is
            the idea that such theories begin as hypotheses and somehow are \"proved\" and become
            \"laws.\" There is no way in which any scientific theory could be proved, and as a
            result
            such theories always remain hypotheses. The fact that such theories \"work\" and permit
            us
            to manipulate and even transform the physical world is no proof that these theories are
            true. Many theories that were clearly untrue have \"worked\" and continue to work for
            long
            periods. The belief that the world is a flat surface did not prevent men from moving
            about on its surface successfully. The acceptance of \"Aristotelian\" beliefs about
            falling bodies did not keep people from dealing with such bodies, and doing so with
            considerable success. Men could have played baseball on a flat world under Aristotle\'s
            laws and still pitched curves and hit home runs with as much skill as they do today.
            Eventually, to be sure, erroneous theories will fail to work and their falseness will be
            revealed, but it may take a very long time for this to happen, especially if men
            continue to operate in the limited areas in which the erroneous theories were
            formulated.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus scientific theories must be recognized as hypotheses and as
            subjective human
            creations no matter how long they remain unrefuted. Failure to recognize this helped to
            kill ancient science in the days of the Greeks. At that time the chief enemies of
            science were the rationalists. These men, with all the prestige of Pythagoras and Plato
            behind them, argued that the human senses are not dependable but are erroneous and
            misleading and that, accordingly, the truth must be sought without using the senses and
            observation, and by the use of reason and logic alone. The scientists of the day were
            trying to reduce the complexity of innumerable observed qualities to the simplicity of
            quantitative differences of a few fundamental elements. This is, of course, exactly what
            scientists have always done, seeking to explain the subjective complexity of qualitative
            differences, such as temperature, color, texture, and hardness, in quantitative terms.
            But in doing this they introduced a dichotomy between \"appearance\" and \"reality\"
            that
            became one of the fundamental categories of ancient intellectual controversy. All
            things, as the scientists said, may be made up of different proportions of the four
            basic elements—earth, water, air, fire—but they certainly do not appear to be. The same
            problem arises in our own day when scientists tell us that the most solid piece of rock
            or metal is very largely made up of empty space between minute electrical charges.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Pythagoreans argued that if things are really not what they seem,
            our
            senses are
            at fault because they reveal to us the appearance (which is not true) rather than the
            reality (which is true). This being so, the senses are undependable and erroneous and
            should not be used by us to determine the nature of reality; instead we should use the
            same reason and logic that showed us that reality was not like the appearance of things.
            It was this recourse to rational processes independent of observation that led the
            ancient rationalists to assume the theories violating Occam\'s razor that became
            established as \"Aristotelian\" and dominated men\'s ideas of the universe until, almost
            two thousand years later, they were refuted by Galileo and others who re-established
            observation and Occam\'s razor in scientific procedure.

            can be
            done in
            three ways: (a) by checking back, (b) by foretelling new observations, and (c) by
            experimentation with controls. Of these the first two are simple enough. We check back
            by examining all the evidence used in formulating the hypothesis to make sure that the
            hypothesis can explain each observation.

            to predict the exact time and place for a future eclipse of the sun, or if the theory
            makes it possible for us to calculate the size and position of an unknown planet that is
            subsequently found through the telescope, we may regard our hypotheses as greatly
            strengthened.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The third type of test of a hypothesis, experimentation with controls,
            is
            somewhat
            more complicated. If a man had a virus he believed to be the cause of some disease, he
            might test it by injecting some of it into the members of a group. Even if each person
            who had been injected came down with the disease, the experiment would not be a
            scientific one and would prove nothing. The persons injected could have been exposed to
            another common source of infection, and the injection might have had nothing to do with
            the disease. In order to have a scientific experiment, we must not inject every member
            of the group but only every other member, keeping the uninjected alternate members under
            identical conditions except for the fact that they have not been injected with the
            virus. The injected members we call the experimental group; the uninjected persons we
            call the control group. If all other conditions are the same for both groups, and the
            injected experimental group contract the disease while the control group do not, we have
            fairly certain evidence that the virus causes the disease. Notice that the conditions of
            the control group and the experimental group are the same except for one factor that is
            different (the injection), a fact allowing us to attribute any difference in final
            result to the one factor that is different.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The nature of experimentation with controls must be clearly
            understood,
            because it has
            frequently been distorted from ignorance or malice. A number of years ago a book called
            Science Is a Sacred Cow made a malicious attack on science. In this work the method of
            experimental science was explained somewhat like this: on Monday I drink whiskey and
            water and get drunk; on Tuesday I drink gin and water and get drunk; on Wednesday I
            drink vodka and water and get drunk; on Thursday I think about this and decide that
            water makes me drunk, since this is the only common action I did every day. This
            perversion of scientific method is the exact opposite of a scientific experiment. In
            this performance we assumed that all conditions were different except one, and
            attributed cause to the one condition that was the same. In scientific method we
            establish all conditions the same except one, and attribute causation to the one factor
            that is different. In the perversion of scientific method we made an assumption that was
            not proved and probably could not be proved—that all conditions, except drinking water,
            were different—and then we tried to attribute causation to the one common factor. But
            there never could be only one factor the same, since, as an experimental animal, I was
            breathing air each day and doing a number of other common actions, including drinking
            alcohol.

            Science Is a Sacred Cow, attracted undeserved attention and was publicized in America\'s
            most widely read picture magazine as a worthy book and a salutary effort to readjust the
            balance of America\'s idolatry of science. The magazine article in question reprinted
            extracts from the book, including the section on experimental method, and seriously
            presented to millions of readers the experimental proof that water is an intoxicant as
            an example of scientific method.

            also
            been
            questioned on the ground that theories of the social sciences are too changeable. We are
            told that every generation must rewrite the history of the past or even that every
            individual must form his own picture of history. This may be true to some extent, but it
            is almost equally true of the natural sciences. Science is a method, not a body of
            knowledge or a picture of the world. The method remains largely unchanged, except for
            refinements, generation after generation, but the body of scientific knowledge resulting
            from the use of this method or the world picture it provides is changing from month to
            month and almost from day to day. The scientific picture of the universe today is quite
            different from that of even so recent a man as Einstein, and immensely different from
            those of Pasteur and Newton. And even at a given moment the body of knowledge possessed
            by any single scientist or the world picture he has made from that knowledge is quite
            different from that possessed by other scientists. Yet such persons are all worthy to be
            called scientists if they use scientific method. The same is true in the social
            sciences.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The one major difference between the natural sciences and the social

            assumption, made in the former, that human thoughts cannot influence what happens. This
            is an assumption, justified by the rule of simplicity, although few persons recognize
            that it is. There is a considerable body of evidence that human thoughts can influence
            the physical world, but this evidence, segregated into such fields as parapsychology or
            the psychic world, is not acceptable to the natural sciences. As a result, phenomena
            such as poltergeist manifestations (largely because they cannot be repeated on request)
            go unexplained and are generally ignored by the natural sciences. The latter continue to

            human thoughts

            complicated situation created by this admission. Thus we assume that a rock, dropped
            from a high window, will fall even if everyone in the world expected it to rise or
            wanted it to rise. On the other hand, we are quite prepared to see the price of General

            unfamiliar. Insects do so and so too do such animals as chicks and ducklings. But man is

            taking care of itself, and remains relatively helpless for years. Indeed, it would seem
            that twenty or more years are necessary before a human being reaches maturity.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The helpless condition of the new-born human arises from the fact that
            his
            neurological and muscular systems are largely undeveloped and uncoordinated. His nervous
            system in particular is like the telephone system of a great city in which almost none
            of the connections from phone to phone or from phone to switchboard are closed. Of
            course, this comparison is by no means perfect, for the human nervous system is much
            more complicated, much more adaptable, and much faster than any telephone system. The
            human brain alone, as a kind of central switchboard, has millions of neural connections.
            Other millions are distributed throughout the body. The way in which these are connected
            up, or even the fact that they come to be connected up at all, depends on what happens
            to the child, how he is trained, and how he grows. The things he is capable of becoming
            originally we can speak of as his potentialities; the things he does become, as the
            result of experience and training, we can speak of as actualities. The sum of his
            potentialities we call human nature, while the sum total of his actualities we call
            human personality. It is quite clear that human nature (potential qualities) is very
            much wider than human personality (actually developed qualities). Indeed, we might
            assume that everyone, at birth (or even at conception) has the potentiality for being
            aggressive or submissive, selfish or generous, cowardly or brave, masculine or feminine,
            pugnacious or peaceful, violent or gentle, and so forth, and that which of these
            potential qualities becomes actual (or to what degree it does so) depends, very largely,
            on the way in which each person is trained or on the experiences he encounters as he
            grows up. The fact that there are societies or tribes in which almost everyone is
            aggressive (like the Apaches) and that there are other closely related tribes in which
            almost everyone is submissive (like the Zuni), and the fact that infants, taken from one
            such tribe and reared in the other, grow up to have in full measure the typical
            characteristics of their adopted tribe would seem to indicate both that all such people
            are potentially about the same at conception and that their personalities are largely a
            consequence of the way in which they are reared. If this is so, it is clear that the way
            in which people are brought up is very important. This is, of course, evident from the
            consideration already mentioned; namely, that humans are helpless at birth and must be
            cared for and trained during a period of many years. The way in which they are cared for
            and trained depends very largely on the personalities of the people whom they encounter
            as they are growing up, but these personalities again depend on the way in which these
            adults were reared. Thus there appear in any society certain patterns of action, of
            belief, and of thought that are passed on from generation to generation, always slightly
            different both from generation to generation and from person to person in any single

            think but also on the more concrete manifestations of their social environment, such as
            the kind of clothes they wear, the kind of shelters in which they live, the kind of
            tools they have for making a living, the kind of food they eat and how they eat it, the
            kind of toys they have to amuse themselves, as well as the kind of weapons they have to
            defend themselves. All of these things, patterns of action, feeling, and thought, as
            well as concrete objects used in these activities, are known in the social sciences as
            culture. This culture forms the environment in which a child grows up as the natural
            environment surrounds the baby turtle as it grows up in the sea. Man is surrounded by
            natural environment, to be sure; but it is much more remote from him than from the
            turtle, for, in man\'s case, culture intervenes as a kind of insulation between him and
            his natural environment. In fact, the surrounding environment of culture penetrates both
            into him as a person and into his natural environment, changing both. His neurological
            reactions in behavior, in feeling, and in thought are largely determined by his cultural
            environment, and at the same time this cultural environment modifies his natural
            environment by such activities as heating his home, cooking his food, cutting down
            forests, draining swamps, killing off animals, and generally modifying the face of the
            earth.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have said that the individual\'s reactions in behavior, in feeling,
            and in thought
            (what we call his personality) are largely determined by his cultural environment. At
            the same time, his personality is part of the cultural environment of those people whom
            he meets. And, as already said, only by such relationships is his personality developed
            from his human nature. All this makes a human being so different from a turtle that
            nothing very relevant to human behavior can be learned from the study of turtle
            behavior. With the turtle we are dealing with a twofold situation: the turtle and his
            environment. With the human being we are dealing with a threefold situation: the human
            being surrounded by his culture and both together surrounded by the natural environment—
            and by other cultures. Where a turtle lays dozens of eggs and hopes that some turtles
            from those eggs can be carried to maturity by obedience to fairly rigid instincts, the
            human has almost no rigid instincts, and adapts his personality to his culture. The
            culture in turn must adapt itself to the natural environment. Thus, if the natural
            environment changes, the turtle must change his nature, while man merely changes his
            culture (and thus his personality). But this beautifully flexible relationship requires
            such a long period of training and learning during which human nature becomes a human
            personality and the individual becomes able to care for himself, that humans are
            dependent upon their parents for many years. Accordingly, humans have few offspring, and
            each offspring is very valuable, since the survival of the species does not depend (as
            with turtles) on the more or less accidental survival of a very few out of the many
            reproduced, but depends instead on the ability to bring up almost all who were born and
            to train them so that they can take care of themselves, have the intelligence to modify
            their culture (including their personalities) when it becomes necessary to adapt to the
            environment, and at the same time develop the capacity to use the freedom to change
            their behavior (which this whole situation assumes) in such a way that it will be
            beneficial to themselves and to the group on which they depend for the continuation of
            their culture.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;All this leads us to certain tentative assumptions about human nature,
            about the
            nature of culture, and about the nature of human society. In regard to human nature, it
            would seem that we have to deal with two things: (a) a wide range of potentiality and
            (b) a drive to make these potentialities actual. The range of these potentialities seems
            to run a full gamut from the most concrete and material activities, such as eating or
            moving about, through a broad belt of emotional and social activities to a fairly broad
            range of spiritual and intellectual activities. It would be rash to say that this range
            of potentialities has very specific qualities or needs in it or that there are any
            intrinsic dividing lines separating one potentiality from another. A study of human
            personalities and human cultures would seem to indicate that these potentialities blur
            into one another, that each person has opposing (and even incompatible) extremes of each
            potential quality, and that there can be a good deal of substituting of one potential
            quality for another as these qualities develop into actual characteristics. Any
            divisions we may make in this gamut of human potentialities are probably arbitrary and
            imaginary. We might divide the range into two: physical and spiritual; or into three:
            physical, emotional, and intellectual; or into four (a) material needs, such as food,
            clothing, shelter; (b) sex; (c) gregarious needs, such as companionship; and (d) psychic
            needs, such as a world outlook, psychological security, or the desire to know the
            \"meaning\" of things. We could, indeed, divide this gamut into forty or into four
            hundred
            divisions or levels, since the reality with which our words seek to deal is a subtle,
            continuous, and flexible range quite beyond our ability to grasp clearly or fully. This
            range of human potentialities will sometimes be divided in this book, for purposes of
            historical analysis, into six levels, as follows: (1) military, (2) political, (3)
            economic, (4) social, (5) religious, (6) intellectual, although this division will
            always be made with the full realization that it could, with good justification, be made
            otherwise as five, seven, sixty, or six hundred levels.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This range of human potentialities is also the range of human needs
            because of man\'s
            vital drive that impels him to seek to realize his potentialities. This drive is even
            more mysterious than the potentialities it seeks to realize. Throughout history men have
            given various names to this drive, and there have been endless disputes about its names
            and about its extent and nature. The Classical Greeks, like Aristotle, sought to ignore
            it by merely assuming that everything had a purpose and that everything by its very
            nature sought to achieve its purpose. This is generally known as a teleological
            explanation (from the Greek word teleos, meaning purpose or goal). In the Christian
            Middle Ages this teleological approach was somewhat modified by the belief that, while
            everything had a purpose, things were drawn to seek to fulfill these purposes by the
            love of God. About the year 1600 men began to place this drive inside men (driving them
            on) rather than outside (drawing them on) as before 1600. Spinoza about 1670 called this
            drive the \"soul.\" About 1818 Schopenhauer called it \"will.\" About 1890 Bergson
            called it
            \"the vital urge,\" while at the same time Freud called it \"sex.\" Throughout this
            later
            period many natural scientists called it \"energy.\" Without getting into any
            controversy
            about the merits of these various terms, we can agree with them all that there does seem
            to be some force driving men to seek to realize their potentialities.

            and societies,
            let us try to sum up our conclusions regarding the divisibility of the range of human
            potentialities by the following diagram in which the distance between the line AB and
            the line CD represents this range. The various columns represent various ways in which
            it might be divided. This range as a whole we shall call \"the dimension of

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When these potentialities of human nature are realized, they become
            the
            characteristics of human personality. This is very helpful, for we cannot directly
            observe or study human nature, and are compelled to make assumptions as to what it must
            be like from our studies of human personality. Since the characteristics of human
            personality emerge from the potentialities of human nature as a result of experience and
            training, and since each person\'s experience and training are different, each
            personality is different. At the same time, since each person in the same society is
            brought up in the same culture and thus tends to have similar experiences and similar
            training, most of the persons in a society tend to have a basic personality pattern,
            with similar general characteristics either emphasized or subdued.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Not only is human personality formed by the social environment; the
            social environment
            (or culture) is largely made up of the personalities it has created. In this way culture
            is passed down from generation to generation, always somewhat changed but always largely
            the same. From this point of view culture is known as the social heritage, passing on
            from generation to generation by teaching and learning, most of it unconscious.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When a child is first trying to walk, he may fall without actually
            hurting himself.
            What happens in the next few moments may contribute considerably to the formation of his
            future personality. If an adult swoops down on him, full of sympathetic sounds and
            commiseration, he may decide that he is hurt and begin to cry. This could easily become
            one of the earliest steps toward forming a personality that reacts to the unexpected
            with self-pity. On the other hand, such a fall might lead some neighboring adult to say:
            \"Get up, Jimmy, and try again. You must be more careful and watch where you are
            going.\"
            This could easily be an early step toward self-responsibility and self-reliance.
            Frequently, after such a fall, the child, if ignored, will be frustrated and resentful.
            Struggling to his feet, he may strike out at the nearest person or at some inanimate
            object. Again the reactions of surrounding adults depend upon the personality patterns
            of the culture, and serve to mold the developing personality of the child. There are
            societies where a frustrated child who strikes at an innocent bystander might be
            admired: \"Look at that spirit; isn\'t he the little man!\" This serves to encourage the
            development of a culture based on personalities of irrational aggressions. If, on the
            other hand, a child who displays an early response of aggression to frustration is
            immediately stopped, has his hands slapped to discourage such a reaction, and is sternly
            warned: \"You fell because you were not careful and did not watch what you were doing.
            Mrs. Jones had nothing to do with your fall, so don\'t you dare strike at her . . . ,\"
            in
            such a case the child\'s personality will be turned from aggression to
            self-responsibility.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Episodes such as this occur many times a day in every society. When
            they occur, the
            people involved react to them in accordance with their own personality structures. Few
            of the persons involved in such a situation stop to think that they are involved in a
            teaching situation and are helping to mold the society of the future by helping to mold
            the personality of one of its members. In highly integrated societies, such as most
            primitive tribes, the outcome of each such episode as this will be similar because the
            adults involved have similar personality structures and, as a consequence, the children
            growing up, who occasion such incidents, will experience similar reactions and will
            themselves develop similar personality structures, whatever these may be. In a more
            complex and more disintegrated society, such as our own, the personality structures of
            adults are already so varied that it is difficult to say how they would react to the
            event we have described. Thus quite different reactions might occur, and the children
            who are at the center of these episodes, by experiencing different reactions will grow
            up with different personalities, thus continuing and probably increasing the
            disintegration of the society\'s behavior patterns. There can be no doubt that we could
            have predicted the social response to any act of childish aggression a century or more
            ago with some assurance: the child would have been punished. But today it would be
            impossible to guess what might happen; and, just as the possible reactions have become
            more varied, so the personalities developed from such reactions have become more diverse
            and the society itself has become less integrated.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The culture of a society consists of much more than the personalities
            of the people in
            the society. It consists of all the material things they use, such as the dwellings,
            tools, and clothing already mentioned. It consists of patterns of action, feeling, and
            thought. It consists of established social relationships between one person and another
            as well as between persons and objects. It consists of all kinds of fine, subtle, and
            changeable interrelationships between people and between groups, relationships and
            feelings that are sometimes obvious but are frequently unobserved, reactions that are so
            long established (and thus so \"natural\") that they are neither noticed nor questioned.
            Each individual in a society is a nexus where innumerable relationships of this
            character intersect. Taken as a whole, these innumerable relationships (many of them
            deeply imbedded in his neurological system) form a status, which was slowly created as
            he grew up and will be abruptly destroyed when he dies. The gap created in the fabric of
            society by the death of an individual is slowly closed as some of the ruptured
            relationships are healed over; many others are taken up by different persons; and the
            many social functions that formed the previous status are taken over by a number of
            quite separate persons.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Culture is thus a very subtle and very complex thing. From our point
            of view it is the
            cushion between man\'s purely animal nature and the natural environment. From another
            point of view it is the social heritage passed down from generation to generation. From
            another point of view it is a complex medley of personalities, material objects,
            patterns of behavior, subtle emotional relationships, accepted intellectual ideas and
            intellectual assumptions, and customary individual actions. From any point of view it is
            constantly changing, and forms the chief subject of study in all the social sciences.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This culture is both adaptive and persistent. It is adaptive because
            it is able to
            change, and it is persistent because it will not change without cause. The causes of
            such social change are both internal and external to the culture. They include the
            geographic, the biologic, and the cultural environment. The geographic environment
            includes such things as terrain and climate. Obviously, culture must adapt itself to
            these; consequently, the Eskimos have quite a different culture from the Arabs of the
            desert or the jungle Negroes. And it is equally clear that as geographic conditions
            change, cultures must change too. When all of Europe was under glacial conditions, the
            cultures there must have been different from what they became when all of Europe was
            under thick forests (about 8000 B.C.) or under temperate conditions (about 1000 B.C.).
            The cultures in Europe adapted themselves to these changes.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Similarly, culture adapts itself to changing biologic conditions. When
            the herring
            swarmed in the North Sea in the late Middle Ages or the buffalo swarmed on the North
            American plains in the early nineteenth century, the people living in these areas had
            cultures adapted to these conditions. But when the herring disappeared or the buffalo
            were largely exterminated, the people of northern Europe or the Indians of the Great
            Plains had to adapt their cultures to such changing biologic environment.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In a similar fashion, but to a much greater degree, cultures must
            adapt themselves to
            changing cultural environments. These latter include the culture itself as well as other
            different cultures. When a culture changes because one part of it must adapt itself to a
            different part of the same culture, we say that it is self-adaptive. Thus, when a
            culture gets a different weapon (as when the Indians on the Great Plains obtained the
            horse after 1543 or obtained guns after about 1780), the religious, intellectual,
            social, economic, political, and military aspects of the culture are changed by this new
            acquisition. At the same time a culture must adapt itself to other cultures, as the
            culture of Western civilization has to adapt itself to the culture of Soviet Russia or
            as the people of Tahiti or the people of China had to adapt their cultures to the
            culture of Western civilization during the nineteenth century. When a culture is not
            able to adapt itself to changes in its geographic, biologic, or cultural environment, it
            may perish, just as the cultures of the American Indians or the culture of the ancient
            Carthaginians perished when these peoples were unable to adapt themselves to the impact
            of Western civilization or to that of Classical civilization. It is worth noting that
            when animals (like the dinosaurs) are incapable of adapting their physical structure to
            changes in the environment, the species perishes; but man (who has the insulation of
            culture between his physical structure and his environment) merely undergoes destruction
            of his culture instead of destruction of his species when his culture cannot adapt
            itself to changes in the environment.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It sometimes happens that a culture is unable to adapt itself to
            changes in part of
            itself. For example, a change in weapons (which is part of culture) may be so drastic
            (like the atom bomb) that the other parts of the same culture, such as the economic and
            political systems, cannot adapt themselves to this military change and the culture will
            perish. This means that cultural changes are not necessarily progressive, but are
            frequently irrational, retrogressive, and destructive. A culture may even commit
            suicide. For example, at a remote period the culture of the Aztec people in Mexico
            changed on the religious level by the introduction of human sacrifices to one of their
            gods. The military level adapted itself to this religious change by changing its tactics
            from an effort to kill the enemy to an effort to capture the enemy (so that captives
            could be used as religious sacrifices). This change injured the culture\'s ability to
            defend itself because the Aztecs no longer fought to defend themselves or to kill their
            enemies, but fought to capture them for sacrifices. When the Spaniards under Hernando
            Cortez arrived in Mexico in 1519, the Aztec defense was much hampered by the fact that
            they were fighting to capture while the Spaniards were fighting to kill.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because culture is adaptive to itself, it is integrative; but, because
            it is also
            adaptive to diverse external influences as well as to the human drive to realize human
            potentialities, no culture ever becomes integrated. By \"integrative\" we mean that the
            different parts of a culture adapt themselves to one another and tend to become
            increasingly an interlocking unified system in which each part fits snugly into all the
            surrounding parts. But this result is never reached, for, at the very moment that one
            part of culture is adapting itself to another part to become more closely fitted to it,
            it is becoming less adapted to some third part which is also changing under influences
            from some other source. Thus no culture ever becomes integrated. This is a good thing,
            because a fully integrated culture would be rigid and would resist change so completely
            that it would become incapable of adapting itself to changes in its external environment
            on the one side and incapable of fulfilling man\'s drive to realize his potentialities
            on
            the other side. A fully integrated culture would be like the dinosaurs, which had to
            perish because they were no longer able to adapt themselves to changes in the external
            environment. Accordingly, culture is made up of loose-fitting parts that are only
            partially adapted to one another, to the environment, and to human needs, and are
            constantly changing in response to shifting pressures from these three directions. It is
            able to survive just because it is not rigidly integrated.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;So far, we have spoken about culture. This is the part of reality with
            which history
            is concerned, but it is only part of the whole picture that historians must examine. The
            rest of this picture is made up of the persons whose activities created the culture. It
            must always be remembered that culture is the consequence of persons seeking to realize
            their potentialities sufficiently to satisfy their inner drives. Without human beings
            there would be no culture. It is equally true that without culture there would be no
            humans (but only animals, in direct contact with their natural environment). The whole
            combination of human beings plus their culture we call by various names such as
            societies, social groups, or even civilizations. These terms have different meanings
            that we shall examine in a moment. Before we do, we should sum up the stage we have

            in the equation
            just given) are misleading, because culture is not rigidly separated from the human
            beings on the one hand and from the environment on the other. Rather it penetrates into
            both. In fact, much of culture is inside human beings because it takes the form of
            trained neurological reactions, developed muscles, emotional reactions, ideas both clear
            and vague, and the established patterns of acting that make the difference between human
            personality and human nature. Human personality is the part of culture that is inside
            human beings and can be observed. Also inside human beings, but beyond the limits of our
            observation, is human nature. Such human nature is made up of potentialities and the
            drive (or drives) to express these. What these potentialities or drives are we cannot
            know from observation but only from inferences based on our observations of personality.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In addition to personality (which is inside human beings), culture has
            manifestations
            outside human beings. This external culture consists of networks of human relationships,
            of concrete tools and instruments (called artifacts), and of symbols for communication
            or expression.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In order to develop their potentialities so that human personalities
            emerge from
            latent human nature, human beings establish relationships with one another. As the child
            develops, these relationships are extended from such fundamental relationships as those
            with mother and nurse to those with parents, siblings, and teachers, to those with
            friends, with the opposite sex, with business relations, with representatives of the
            government (like the police, the tax collector, and the draftboard), and with one\'s
            fellow citizens and fellow soldiers. All these relationships, as part of culture, form
            groups of human beings. Of these groups there are many different kinds. We shall
            distinguish four different kinds at this point: (1) social groups, (2) societies, (3)
            producing societies, and (4) civilizations. All are made up of aggregates of human
            beings with their personalities and external culture.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The social sciences are usually concerned with groups of persons
            rather than with
            individual persons. The behavior of individuals, being free, is unpredictable. There is
            more hope of success when we deal with the activities of aggregates of persons because
            in such aggregates the unpredictable behaviors of individuals tend to cancel each other
            out and become submerged in the behavior of the group as a whole. While the behavior of
            such a group may not be predictable, it is less free to change and can, accordingly, be
            extrapolated in a way that individual behavior does not allow. The same situation exists
            in the physical sciences, where we are quite unable to predict the behavior of any
            individual molecule or particle, but can, with assurance, predict the changes that take
            place in any large aggregate of molecules. These relationships, in the physical
            sciences, can be stated in the form of \"laws\" concerning the pressure, volume, size,
            state, and temperature of aggregates of molecules.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;With aggregates of persons we can state no laws comparable to those
            found in the
            physical sciences, although we can point out tendencies. For example, if an aggregate of
            persons in a stable group undergoes a rise in standards of living we can expect a
            tendency toward an increase in population for the group as a whole, even when we cannot
            say of any individual in the group that he will have more children or even any children
            at all. Moreover, we can study the nature and distribution of the increased supply of
            wealth to determine its effects on the numbers of children in various subgroups within
            the main group. But in the social sciences, where we must be satisfied with tendencies
            rather than with laws, we can analyze the working out of such influences and tendencies
            only if we have a fairly clear idea of the nature and structure of the social groupings
            involved. This is quite different from the natural sciences where laws about the
            behavior of aggregates could be made long before men had any clear idea of how such
            aggregates were made up.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The statement that we can enunciate rules of social tendencies only if
            we have fairly
            clear ideas about the nature of social groupings makes it necessary for us to confess
            that the nature of groups is one of the matters on which there has been wide
            disagreement in the past. In general men\'s ideas on this subject could be placed in
            three classes: (1) those who believed that social groups were merely collections; (2)
            those who believed that social groups were organisms; and (3) those who denied that
            social groups were either collections or organisms but argued that they were sui
            generis, a particular kind of aggregate of their own.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The distinctions between these three points of view on the nature of
            social aggregates
            could be expressed roughly as follows. A collection is no more than the sum of its
            parts, and the parts are interchangeable within the collection. An organism is more than
            the sum of its parts (since they have patterns of relationships), and the parts, being
            fitted to their position and role in the whole, are not interchangeable. The third
            class, made up of those who maintain that a social group is sui generis, occupy a middle
            ground between the \"collectionists\" and the \"organicists\" since they say that the
            whole
            is more than the sum of its parts but that the parts (that is, the individuals in the
            group) are interchangeable in their functions and positions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A discussion such as this about the nature of social groups may seem
            to be a merely
            academic dispute of little practical significance, but, as a matter of fact, it has been
            profoundly significant throughout human history. Those who have seen human groups as
            organisms, from the ancient Greeks to Hitler, have derived from this point of view
            certain corollaries about the relations of the individual to the group that have been
            destructive of individualism and of human liberties. For in an organism the parts exist
            for the sake of the whole and are subordinate to it; they must be sacrificed if
            necessary for the welfare of the whole. Thus Aristotle says that a man cannot live apart
            from the state, as an animal could or a god could, because a man cut off from the state
            is like a thumb cut off from a hand: it is no longer a thumb but merely looks like a
            thumb. In saying this he is using an organic analogy which explains the totalitarian
            character of the Greek polis or of the later Roman imperium. Both were as prepared to
            sacrifice the individual to the state as we would be to cut off a cancerous thumb in
            order to save the whole organism.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the argument that a social group is only a
            collection and thus
            simply an aggregate of individuals with no established patterns of relationships and
            with no aims or purposes beyond those of the individuals who make it up is equally
            pernicious of human values. For a collection can have no established traditions or any
            purposes of its own and can expect no spirit of sacrifice or of public service from its
            members; instead, it must expect its members to be as competitive in their relations
            with one another as they would be toward any member of an outside group.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The middle ground that regards a social group as an aggregate of its
            own distinctive
            type avoids the difficulties both of totalitarian organicism and of the rampant
            individualism of the collectionists. Because of their belief that the whole has pattern,
            and thus is more than a mere aggregation of individuals, holders of the middle ground
            are able to preserve social tradition and to encourage devotion to the whole as an
            entity with its own distinctive values; but by their insistence that individuals are
            interchangeable within the whole they are able to protect the ultimate value of the
            individual and to infer that the whole exists for the sake of the individual, and not
            the opposite, providing him with opportunities to develop his higher potentialities
            through social cooperation in a way that would not be possible in a mere collection of
            individuals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From centuries of argument on these matters there has begun to emerge
            a sufficient
            consensus for us to say that students of the social sciences today tend to avoid either
            of the extreme positions of organicism or individualism and tend to agree that social
            groups are aggregates of a special kind subject to their own rules and characteristics.
            Accordingly we must seek to define a social group and to show the various types of these
            that can exist. There are three basic types of such social aggregates: (1) social
            groups, (2) societies, and (3) civilizations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A social group is an aggregate of persons who have had relationships
            with one another
            long enough for these to have become customary, and for them to come to regard
            themselves as a unit with well-defined limits. The essential thing about a group is that
            its members can say who is in it and who is not. The term covers such aggregates as a
            class in history, a football team, a fraternity, a university, a business concern, a
            parish or church, a political party or a state. All these groups come into existence
            gradually as relationships are established and mutual recognition grows. When a class in
            history or a football squad assembles for the first time, it is not a group, but simply
            an aggregate of persons, and the group comes into existence only gradually. In fact, it
            continues to develop as long as it is of any social significance.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A society is a group whose members have more relationships with one
            another than they
            do with outsiders. As a result, a society forms an integrative unity and is
            comprehensible. It is the vehicle of the culture we were talking about before. A society
            has a culture because it is a unity, and it is a unity because its members have more
            relationships with one another than with outsiders. A group does not have any culture of
            its own; the culture of a group is the culture of the society in which the group is. By
            some stretching of the use of words, the personalities of the members of a group might
            be regarded as the culture of the group; but culture consists of more than personalities
            (since it also includes external culture), and the personalities of any group have more
            relationships with people who are outside the group than with people inside the group,
            if for no other reason than the fact that these personalities developed by means of
            relationships with outsiders long before these personalities joined the group. If this
            were not true, and the personalities of the members of the group had been developed by
            means of relationships within the group, then this aggregate of which we are speaking is
            a society and not a group.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is sometimes difficult for some people to distinguish between a
            group and a society
            because they fail to see the most fundamental relationships among people. It is
            frequently helpful to think of some of the varied relationships that can exist among
            people. If this is done, it becomes clear that the Zuni Indians or the Japanese about
            1850 were societies, but that a history class, a football team, or a corporation is a
            group. The Zuni or the Japanese were societies because they had their religious,
            intellectual, social, economic, and political relations with other members of the same
            group. The members of a class, of a football team, or of a corporation have most of
            these relationships with outsiders. Members of such a group have their religious
            relationships with the whole Christian tradition, while their intellectual relationships
            are with the whole tradition of Western culture; their social relationships are with
            outsiders to the group, such as parents, sweethearts, or friends; their economic
            relationships are with the whole capitalist economic world and beyond (for example, they
            drink coffee for breakfast); and their political relationships are with all their fellow
            citizens and even outside that. In such a wide flung nexus of relationships, the
            relatively narrow range of mutual relationships possessed by members of the same class,
            the same team, or the same corporation shows clearly that these latter are groups and
            not societies.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The real problem in distinguishing between groups and societies arises
            when we look at
            modern political units like the state or nation. Most states, such as Canada, France,
            Italy, Cuba, or the United States, are not societies but groups because their members\'
            relationships with one another are only political and social, while their religious,
            intellectual, and economic relationships are in a much wider context. The religious
            ideas of people in the countries mentioned are expressed in terms of monotheism, the
            Christian ethical and doctrinal systems, the deity as a masculine being located in the
            sky, and so forth. There is nothing specifically Canadian, French, or American in these
            ideas. On the other hand, they are quite different from the religious ideas of peoples
            in a different society. These latter might be expressed in terms of a female deity
            residing within the earth, or of nonhuman shape, or demanding human sacrifice, and so
            on. Similarly, the eating patterns of peoples in all the countries mentioned are very
            similar: they cook their food, eat bread made from wheat, drink coffee, prefer steaks,
            and are rather unlikely to be found eating raw blubber or fried locusts. Similarly, they
            all trace family descent through the father, practice monogamy, have private property,
            seek profits, accept the scientific tradition, use explosives as weapons, and so on.
            These similarities are so much more numerous and so much more important than the
            dissimilarities between these countries that the personality patterns and the general
            outlook on the universe that bind these people together into a single system of
            relationships make them have more relationships with one another across political
            frontiers than they do with members of any single group within such frontiers. The fact
            that Canadians have more relationships outside Canada than inside it means that Canada
            could not be understood or even described without using terms like Christian,
            scientific, industrial, monogamous, nationalism, Protestant, capitalism, parliament,
            democracy, railroads, rifles, ballots, radioactivity, and such. None of these terms, nor
            the things which they represent, is of Canadian origin nor can they be understood in
            purely Canadian terms. The need to use them in describing Canada means that Canada can
            be understood only as part of the larger system from which these words (and the objects
            they represent) arise. This large system is, as we shall see, Western civilization;
            Canada can only be understood as a political group within Western culture.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This distinction between groups and societies (with the former defined
            as an aggregate
            whose members have more relationships with outsiders than with one another) means that a
            society is a comprehensible unit, while a group is not a comprehensible unit. A group
            can be known but it cannot be comprehended, because comprehension involves knowledge of
            a major part of the relationships existing in an aggregate. Such knowledge is not
            possible within a group because many of the relationships of the members of a group go
            outside the group to members of the larger unit, the society, of which the group is a
            part.

            itself. Indeed, it is a safe rule that no significant questions about anything inside a
            group can be answered except by reference to things outside the group.

            Fortune arrived among the Dobu, B. Malinowski among the Trobriand Islanders, Captain
            Cook among the Polynesians, Pizarro among the Incas, or Marco Polo among the Chinese, it
            is possible to obtain explanations and understanding of what is going on if there are

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since a society is comprehensible, while a group is not, most
            political units (being
            groups) are not comprehensible units. Political units are comprehensible only when a
            single political unit covers the whole of a society. This is frequently not the case,
            although it is usually true of the more primitive societies organized in tribes. The
            Zuni, for example, like many of the other Indian tribes, were both a political unit and
            a society. Japan and China were, about 1850, comprehensible political units because they
            were separate societies. In most advanced societies it will be found that the religious,
            intellectual, social, economic, and even military patterns are roughly coterminous with
            each other and with the outline of the society as a whole. But in such a society the
            political units usually cut across these other patterns. We can know a great deal about
            such political units, but we cannot understand them because understanding requires
            knowledge of a major portion of the patterns of relationships in society as a whole.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As we examine numerous societies like that of the Eskimos, the Zuni
            Indians, the
            Chinese, the Hottentots, or our own Western civilization, we see that there are two
            different kinds of such societies: (a) parasitic societies and (b) producing societies.
            The former are those which live from hunting, fishing, or merely gleaning. By their
            economic activities they do not increase, but rather decrease, the amount of wealth in
            the world. The second kind of societies, producing societies, lives by agricultural and
            pastoral activities. By these activities they seek to increase the amount of wealth in
            the world. As we shall see later, the distinction between these two kinds of societies
            is of most fundamental importance. Man was a parasite from his first appearance on the
            earth, perhaps as long as a million years ago. Only with the discovery of the techniques
            of agriculture and domestication less than ten thousand years ago did it become possible
            for man to be a producer, and, even during the last ten thousand years, there have been
            more parasitic societies (like the Sioux or the Eskimos) than there have been producing
            societies (like the Zuni or the Chinese).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If we concentrate our attention on the producing societies that have
            existed during
            the last ten thousand years, we see again that there are at least two distinct kinds.
            There are simple producing societies like the Zuni (with agriculture), or the Masai
            (with pastoral herds), and there are much more complex societies that we call
            \"civilizations\" (like the Chinese, the Aztecs, or ourselves). The distinction between
            a
            civilization and an ordinary producing society is not easy to draw, and it is too early
            in our discussion to seek to draw it at this time. However, it is clear that most of the
            civilizations with which we are familiar have had both writing and city life.
            Accordingly, as a temporary definition, we might say that a civilization is a producing
            society that has writing and city life.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might sum up our definitions to this point by saying that
            aggregates of persons may
            be divided into (a) collections, (b) groups, or (c) societies. The members of a
            collection, coming casually together in time and place, have no established
            relationships. The members of a group do have relationships sufficiently established to
            be able to identify who is or who is not a member of the group, but they have the major
            portion of their total relationships with persons who are not members of the group. A
            society, on the other hand, is made up of persons who have the major part of their
            relationships with one another. It may be either parasitic or producing, and if it is a
            producing society it may or may not be a civilization. These rather simple but very
            significant distinctions can be summed up in a table:

            civilizations), we see that there have been very many parasitic societies, a much
            smaller number of producing societies, and very few civilizations. As for the relative
            numbers of each, we might say that there have been hundreds of thousands of the first,
            at least thousands of the second, but not more than two dozen civilizations. Since our
            chief concern in this book is with our own society, which is a civilization, the rest of
            this book will be concerned with the nature of this particular kind of society only.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Of the two dozen civilizations, all of which existed during the last
            ten thousand
            years, seven have been alive in recent years, while the rest, amounting to approximately
            seventeen in number, lived and died long ago. All of them, both living and dead, can be
            divided into three groups depending upon the carbohydrate plant they produced as an
            energy food. There were three such foods: maize, rice, and grain (wheat and barley). In
            the maize group were two civilizations: (a) the Andean civilization, which began about
            1500 B.C., culminated in the Inca Empire, and was destroyed by outside invaders about
            A.D. 1600; (b) the Mesoamerican civilization, which began about 1000 B.C., culminated in
            the Aztec Empire, and was destroyed by similar invaders about A.D. 1550. Both of these
            civilizations were derived from a common source, a producing society which was not a
            civilization, probably situated in some hilly area in the northern part of South
            America.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The \"rice\" group is somewhat misnamed since the chief carbohydrates
            which supported it
            in the earliest period and have continued to be used since were millet and wheat. This
            group has at least three (and perhaps as many as six) civilizations in it. Only an
            expert on the history of the Far East could speak with confidence on this subject. Since
            this is not one of our chief areas of interest, we shall oversimplify the situation by
            listing no more than three civilizations. Of these the earliest, Sinic civilization,
            rose in the valley of the Yellow River after 2000 B.C., culminated in the Chin and Han
            empires after 250 B.C., and was largely disrupted by Ural-Altaic invaders after A.D.
            400. From the debris of this Sinic civilization there emerged two other civilizations:
            (a) Chinese civilization, which began about A.D. 400, culminated in the Manchu Empire
            after 1644, and was destroyed by European intruders in the period 1790-1930; and (b)
            Japanese civilization, which began about the time of Christ or a little earlier,
            culminated in the Tokugawa Empire after 1600, and may have been completely disrupted by
            Western intruders in the century following 1853.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The earliest civilizations are to be found neither in the maize group
            nor in the rice
            group, but in the much more important group of \"grain civilizations.\" This group is
            more
            important not only because it contains the first civilizations to come into existence
            but also because it contains such a large number of civilizations, seventeen at least.
            The earliest civilizations were derived from a number of closely related producing
            societies that we shall call the Neolithic Garden cultures, or, less accurately, the
            Painted Pottery Peoples. The latter were the first peoples to have agriculture, and thus
            formed the earliest producing societies in history. At the risk of considerable
            oversimplification, we might say that these earliest agriculturalists appeared in the
            hilly terrain of western Asia, probably not far from Armenia, about nine thousand years
            ago. Because they knew nothing about replenishing the fertility of the soil, they
            practiced \"shifting cultivation,\" moving to new fields when yields declined in their
            old
            fields. In consequence, they expanded steadily, reaching Denmark and Britain in the west
            and China in the east before 2000 B.C., that is to say, within five thousand years. In
            the course of this movement they found, in various alluvial river valleys, sites adapted
            to permanent large-scale settlement because, in such valleys, the annual flood
            replenished the fertility of the soil by depositing a layer of fertile sediment; and,
            accordingly, the need for \"shifting cultivation\" ended and the possibility of
            permanent,
            eventually urban, settlements was offered. This possibility was realized in four
            alluvial valleys of the Old World, in Mesopotamia during the sixth millennium B.C., in
            the valley of the Nile shortly afterward, in the valley of the Indus River early in the
            fourth millennium B.C., and in the Huang Ho Valley of China late in the third millennium
            B.C. The last of these has already been mentioned as the source of the Sinic
            civilization, which was the parent of the Chinese, Japanese, and probably other Far
            Eastern civilizations.

            civilization,
            began after 6000 B.C., reached a peak of achievement about 1700 B.C., and ended in a
            series of empires of which the last was the Persian. That empire and the civilization of
            which it was the political aspect were destroyed by outside invaders, the Greeks under
            Alexander the Great, after the end of the fourth century. Parallel with this, a quite
            different civilization in the Nile Valley reached its peak about 2300 B.C., established
            its greatest geographic extent as the Egyptian Empire a millennium later, and was
            destroyed by the same Greek invaders in the few generations following 330 B.C.

            culminated in their
            respective empires, and perished at the hands of outside invaders in a strikingly
            similar process. In the Indus Valley the Indie civilization began about 3500 B.C.,
            reached a peak of achievement about 2200 B.C., culminated in a political empire that we
            might call the Harappa Empire, and was destroyed by the Aryan invaders who came into the
            Indian subcontinent from the northwest after 1700 B.C. From the wreckage of this
            culture, there was constructed a quite distinct civilization, which we may call Hindu.
            This reached a peak of achievement about 100 B.C., and culminated in a series of empires
            of which the last, called the Mogul Empire, was established early in the sixteenth
            century. This empire and the civilization of which it formed a part were destroyed by
            European invaders in the centuries following 1700. From the wreckage of this Hindu
            civilization a new civilization seems to be coming into existence in our own time.

            civilizations
            appeared there, largely from Mesopotamian inspiration. On the island of Crete the
            earliest civilization outside an alluvial valley began to form toward the end of the
            fourth millennium B.C. It reached its peak in the Minoan period, about 1500 B.C., and
            ended with the Mycenaean Empire, destroyed by the Dorian invaders in the twelfth century

            shortest-lived of all
            civilizations. Known as the Hittite civilization, this had its beginnings after 2000
            B.C., reached its widest imperial extent about 1300, and perished a few generations
            later from the onslaughts of invading Iron Age intruders, cousins of the Dorians who
            were simultaneously destroying Cretan civilization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the Levant, during the same period, there appeared, under
            Mesopotamian stimulus, a
            civilization we might call Canaanite. Beginning before 2000 B.C., it reached its
            greatest extent, from the Red Sea to Spain, about 900 B.C., and ended with that empire
            which, called Punic by the Romans and Carthaginian by us, was known to themselves, more
            accurately, as Canaanite. It perished from Roman invasion before 100 B.C.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From the wreckage of Cretan civilization there began to grow, about
            1000 B.C., a new
            civilization with which we are well acquainted. Known as Classical civilization, or
            Mediterranean civilization from the sea whose shores it occupied, it reached its
            greatest peak in the century divided at 400 B.C., and finally culminated in the Roman
            Empire. It was destroyed, as is generally known, by the Germanic \"barbarian invaders\"
            in
            the fifth century of our era. From its wreckage emerged three civilizations: (a) Western
            civilization, which may culminate in an American empire; (b) Orthodox civilization,
            which seems to be culminating in the Soviet empire; and (c) Islamic civilization, which
            did culminate in the Ottoman Empire, and was disrupted by intruders from Western
            civilization in the first half of the present century.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In this enumeration we have named sixteen civilizations. Of these, two
            existed in the
            New World, three in the Far East, one in Africa, and the others in the rest of Eurasia.
            With careful study it would be possible to distinguish approximately eight more
            civilizations divided about equally between the Near East and the Far East. We refrain
            from attempting to do this because the facts are not clear and any conclusions would be
            disputable. The Near East and the Far East in the history of civilizations are like
            complex masses of quartz from which numerous crystals protrude in various directions.
            The number of crystals in the mass might be disputed, and there would surely be
            disagreement about which portions of the main mass of quartz should be attributed to
            each crystal. It is possible that detailed study of the problem, like microscopic
            examination of the quartz, might help to solve this problem, but for our purpose the
            task is not worth the effort. Just as it is possible for adjacent molecules in the
            quartz mass to be oriented in diverse directions so that they should, perhaps, be
            attributed to different crystals, so it is possible (and indeed is well established)
            that individual persons living next to each other in, let us say, Palestine in the
            thirteenth century B.C., should from their personal orientations be attributed to
            Hittite civilization or to Egyptian civilization or to Canaanite civilization or even to
            Mesopotamian civilization. Such attribution of individuals to civilizations is no matter
            of any historical significance and need not concern us here. Nor need we worry, at this
            time, about the eight or more additional civilizations that have existed at various
            times in Ethiopia, Cambodia, Indonesia, or Tibet. Let us study the nature of
            civilizations, as a scientist would study the nature of crystals, by examining the more

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already mentioned our belief that civilization is an object
            that can be
            studied in a scientific way just as a quartz crystal can be studied. In such a study we
            must, like the student of crystals, examine in a comparative way a large number of
            examples—even, ideally, all the examples available. But it is obvious that a
            civilization is a much more complicated object than a crystal. Let us be explicit about
            that word \"complicated.\" A civilization is complicated, in the first place, because it
            is dynamic; that is, it is constantly changing in the passage of time, until it has
            perished. Furthermore, a civilization is part of the social sciences; that is, it
            contains subjective elements, and these are usually the more important elements in the
            culture. Accordingly, in a civilization, unlike a crystal, what people think or feel can
            influence what exists, changing the object completely in the process. In the third
            place, many aspects of a civilization are continua, existing in such subtle gradations
            and in such varied degrees of abstractness that the divisions we make in it, in the
            course of our analysis, and the words we use as symbols to refer to our analytical
            divisions reflect only very roughly the situation that exists in the reality itself. All
            three of these difficulties are important, but the third, which is frequently ignored in
            discussions of these matters, requires little further examination—for that reason, at
            least.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Much, if not all, of the physical world consists of continua. To say
            this is
            equivalent to saying that much of the physical world is irrational. It exists and it
            operates, but it does these things in ways that cannot be grasped by our conscious
            rational mental processes. This can be seen most easily if we consider first a few
            examples of continua in the physical world.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;How many colors are there in a rainbow? Some answer three—red, yellow,
            blue. Others
            answer six—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. When I was a child in school, for
            some unknown reason, we were told that there were seven colors, the teacher inserting
            \"indigo\" between blue and violet. The proper answer, of course, is that the number of
            colors in the rainbow is infinite. This in itself is something we cannot grasp in any
            rational way. But let us consider what it means.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the first place it means that there is, in the rainbow, no real
            line of division
            between any two colors. If we wish to draw a line we may do so, but we must recognize
            that such a line is imaginary—it may exist in our minds, but it does not exist in the
            rainbow itself.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Moreover, any line that we draw is arbitrary, in the sense that it
            could have been
            drawn with just as much justification somewhere else, perhaps only a hairbreadth away.
            If we draw a line between red and orange and another between orange and yellow, we may
            call the gamut between those two lines orange, but, as a matter of fact, the color is
            quite different on either edge of that gamut. We may decide that orange is a narrower
            range than the gamut between our two lines and, accordingly, slice off the margins of
            the orange gamut, calling the severed margin on one side yellow-orange and the severed
            margin on the other side red-orange. But once again the color is not the same across any
            of these three ranges. In fact, it is impossible to cut off any gamut in a rainbow, no
            matter how narrow we make it, in which the color is the same across the width of the
            gamut. We can move no distance, however infinitesimally small it may be, across the
            rainbow without a change in color. This means that the number of colors in the rainbow
            is infinite. But it also means that the number of colors in any portion of the rainbow
            is infinite. That is, there are as many shades of orange as there are colors in the
            whole rainbow, since both are infinite. Now, this is a truth that we cannot understand
            rationally. It seems contrary to logic and reason that we could add all the existing
            shades of red and yellow to all the existing varieties of orange without increasing the
            number of color varieties we have. The reason is not so much that infinity added to
            infinity gives infinity as that there are no different varieties of colors at all,
            because there are, in fact, no dividing lines in the rainbow itself. When we use the
            plural terms \"colors\" and \"shades\" in reference to a rainbow, we are implying that
            there
            are different colors and accordingly that there are divisions in the rainbow somehow
            separating one shade from another and thus entitling us to speak of these in the plural.
            Since there are no such lines of separation, we would be more accurate if we spoke of
            the rainbow in the singular as \"a continuum of color.\" But, of course, we could not do
            this consistently because it would make it impossible to think about or to talk about
            the colors of any objects. Since the continuum changes across its range, it is
            distinctly different in color from one portion to another, just as dresses, flowers, or
            neckties are different in color from one another. If we are going to talk about these
            very real differences, we must have different words for the different colors involved.
            Thus we must give different color terms to different portions of the rainbow\'s gamut.
            The important truth to remember is that, while the differences between colors are real
            enough, there are no real divisions between colors: these are arbitrary and imaginary.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As is well known, the gamut of radiations of visible light that we
            call the rainbow is
            not an entity in itself but is an arbitrary and imaginary portion cut out of a much
            wider gamut of electromagnetic radiations. The variety of colors in the rainbow arises
            from the fact that the radiations of visible light come at us in wave lengths of
            different frequency. As the wave lengths of these radiant forms of energy get smaller
            (and thus their frequency gets larger), we observe this difference as a shift in color
            toward the blue end of the visible spectrum; as the wave lengths get longer (and the
            frequency less), we observe a color shift toward the red end of the spectrum. If this
            shift of wave length continues, the radiation may pass beyond the range to which our
            eyes are sensitive. Beyond the red we can notice these radiations as heat (infrared);
            beyond the violet we might have difficulty noticing the radiations directly, but their
            consequence would soon appear as a kind of sunburn on our skin. Once again there is no
            dividing line between the visible gamut of radiations and the ultraviolet on one side
            and the infrared on the other side. Some persons can \"see\" further into these than
            others can, and other forms of living creatures can \"see\" further into one or the
            other
            range than any human could. Bees, for example, are fully sensitive to ultraviolet
            radiations, while humans are generally so insensitive to these that they consider glass
            windows, which cut off most ultraviolet, as being fully transparent.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The gamut of radiant energy is much wider than the three subgamuts we
            have mentioned.
            Beyond the invisible ultraviolet are other radiations of even shorter wave length,
            including soft X rays, hard X rays, and finally the very high frequency gamma waves
            released by nuclear explosions. Going the other way in the radiation range, we find that
            there are radiations of increasing wave length beyond the infrared which we call heat.
            These radiations of lower frequency and longer wave length include those used to carry
            our radio and television broadcasts. While we sit here reading, quite unaware of their
            passage, these radiations are going through our bodies. They are different from the
            visible light that allows us to see to read only in the wave lengths and energy content
            of the radiations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This great gamut or range of energy radiations, from the shortest
            gamma waves at one
            end to the longest broadcast waves at the other end, forms a continuum. The difference
            between a deadly gamma radiation and an enjoyable television broadcast, like the
            difference between red and blue, is a very real difference, but it is only a difference
            of wave length (and thus a difference of distance) and not a difference of kind.
            Accordingly, no real lines of demarcation exist in the gamut itself, and the whole range
            forms a single continuum.

            electromagnetic
            radiations is not a quality that has anything to do with energy or with radiations, but
            is true simply because these radiations exist in space and differ from one another
            because of space distinctions, namely, their wave lengths. This spectrum is a continuum,
            and therefore irrational, because space is a continuum, and therefore irrational.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The irrationality of space sounds a little strange to most of us
            because we are so
            familiar with space that we rarely stop to think that we do not really understand it.
            But the irrational quality of space (which arises from the fact that space is infinitely
            divisible) is one of the early discoveries of ancient intellectual history. By 2000 B.C.
            the Babylonians were familiar with the fact that the square of the hypotenuse of a
            right-angle triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
            Introduced to the Greeks in a generalized form by Pythagoras before 500 B.C., this
            statement came to be called the \"Pythagorean theorem.\" Unfortunately, Pythagoras also
            taught that reality was rational and that the truth can be found by the use of reason
            and logic alone, without any need for observation through the senses, which would merely
            serve to confuse us. This rationalist method for discovering the nature of reality was
            accepted by Socrates and Plato (and, in his earlier period, by Aristotle) and led to the
            death of ancient science by contributing to a denigration of observation, testing of
            hypotheses, and experiment. It is one of the great ironies of history that thinkers like
            Pythagoras and Plato helped to kill ancient science by propagating the belief that
            observation was not necessary since reality was rational, and therefore its nature could
            be found by the use of reason and logic alone, long after a pupil of Pythagoras,
            Hippasus of Metapontium, had used the Pythagorean theorem to demonstrate that space (and
            thus reality) is irrational.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The demonstration of the irrationality of space arose from the proof
            that the diagonal
            of a square is incommensurable with its side. We would say that, if the side of a square
            is one unit long, its diagonal, by the Pythagorean theorem, is √2 units long. And the
            square root of 2, we say, is an irrational number. But few of us really know what we
            mean by the word \"irrational\" in this sense. There are three ways of looking at it,
            each
            a slightly different way of looking at a quite irrational situation. We sometimes say
            that √2 is an endless decimal which begins with 1.41421 . . . and continues forever in
            an infinite series of digits which never ends and never repeats itself. Or we could say
            that √2 is a number which cannot be expressed as a fraction—that is, as a ratio between
            two rational numbers. But both of these statements are simply alternative ways of
            talking about the utterly irrational fact that there is no common unit of distance, no
            matter how small we make it, which will go into the side of a square a certain number of
            times and will also go into the diagonal of the square a round number of times without
            anything left over. Rationally we would think that if we took as a unit of measurement a
            distance which was infinitely small—like one-sextillionth of a cat\'s whisker or even
            one-sextillionth of that or however small a unit was needed—that we could eventually
            find a unit so small that it would go evenly into both the side and the diagonal. But
            the fact is that there is no unit, however small, which will go evenly into both
            distances, so that there is no common unit between them, and we must say that they are
            incommensurable. But this is not a situation that is rationally comprehensible to our
            conscious reasoning powers, and it is quite non logical. But it is true.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This quality of irrationality of space is not something exceptional,
            either in space
            or in other aspects of reality. The radius of a circle is similarly incommensurable with
            its circumference; the irrational relationship between the two distances is signified by
            the ratio we call π. This quality of irrationality rests on the fact that space is
            infinitely divisible; no matter how close together we make two points, the number of
            points between them remains infinite. The infinite colors of the rainbow, like the
            incommensurability of a square and its diagonal or of a circle and its radius, are
            simply applications of this irrational quality of space.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A similar irrational quality is to be found in time. We usually think
            of time as a
            succession of intervals. It is really a continuous flow, and any intervals we may choose
            to put into it, be they seconds, hours, or centuries, are arbitrary and imaginary. And
            in consequence, any conclusions we derive or any inferences we may draw from such
            intervals may be mistaken. We have twenty-four hours in the day as a purely conventional
            arrangement going back to our early ancestors in the Neolithic Garden cultures who had a
            number system based on twelve and passed on to us, as relics of that system, such
            arrangements as twelve eggs in a dozen, twelve inches in a foot, twelve pennies in a
            shilling, twenty-four parts in a carat, twelve ounces in a pound of gold, twelve deities
            on Mount Olympus, and many other odd facts of which one of the most pervasive today is
            that teenage begins with thirteen. From the Neolithic belief that day or night should
            each have twelve parts we derived our twenty-four-hour day, but since these divisions
            are arbitrary and imaginary, we could with equal justification have a day of ten hours
            or of twenty-three or twenty-five hours.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Most of us are familiar with the paradoxes of Zeno, especially with
            the one about a
            race between Achilles and a tortoise. Zeno argued that if the tortoise got a head start,
            Achilles could never catch up with him even if he could run much faster. Zeno felt that
            if the tortoise was a certain distance ahead when Achilles started, the tortoise would
            move forward a little farther while Achilles was covering the handicap distance and
            would, thus, still be ahead when Achilles finished the handicap distance. Accordingly,
            Achilles must keep on running to overcome the new increment, but by the time he had made
            up that increment the tortoise would have moved forward a new amount and would still be
            slightly ahead. According to Zeno, this process would continue forever, the tortoise
            advancing a decreasingly small amount while Achilles was making up the tortoise\'s
            previous increment. A mathematician might say that the distance between the two would
            approach zero as a limit but would reach that limit only after an infinite number of
            intervals (either of time or of distance) and that Achilles would, accordingly, not
            catch up in any finite number of intervals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The explanation of this paradox of Zeno\'s rests on the fact that the
            space and time
            through which the contestants are running are both continua, but Zeno, by treating them
            as if they were a succession of intervals, introduced an untrue condition, and from this
            contrary-to-fact assumption (that lime or space exists as a sequence of intervals) he
            derived a contrary-to-fact conclusion (that Achilles can never catch up).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Such paradoxes are good examples of the methodological rule that logic
            and rationality
            do not apply to continua. As we shall show later, this is one of the basic rules of
            historical method (although, it must be confessed, few historians give it much thought).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Space and time are not the only continua. Another familiar example is
            the system of
            real numbers. Since this is a continuum, we can state a rule: no two numbers can be
            placed so close together that there is not an infinite number of numbers between them.
            For example, between 3 and 4 are an infinite number of numbers. One of these is π. As we
            have said, π is irrational, and, accordingly, although it is a very exact number we
            cannot write it with the ordinary ten symbols used in writing numbers. If we say that π
            is 3.14, we do not refer to a single number but are really saying that π is one of the
            infinite number of numbers in the gamut from 3.135 to 3.145. In that gamut we could
            indicate that π was in a much narrower gamut (which still contains an infinite number of
            numbers) by writing its value as 3.141592. This refers to the infinite number of numbers
            in the gamut of numbers ranging from 3.1415915 to 3.1415925. Since the value of π is
            known to over a thousand decimal places, we can define the gamut of numbers within which
            π lies more and more narrowly simply by carrying the numerical expression for π to more
            decimal places. But each gamut, no matter how narrow it gets, refers to an infinite
            number of numbers, because the system of real numbers is a continuum.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;To those who are not familiar with mathematics, all of this discussion
            of √2 and π of
            may seem very strange, unreal, and unapplicable to anything with which they are
            concerned. I hope to show that the remarks I have just made about numbers are applicable
            not only to statements we all make about many familiar things but also to history.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A moment\'s thought will show that any statement about any continuum
            is just the same
            kind of statement as that which we have just made about π. Just as any value we may give
            to π refers to a gamut containing an infinite number of numbers and this gamut can be
            made narrower by carrying our statement of the value of π to more decimal places, so any
            statement about any color refers to a gamut that contains an infinite number of colors.
            Thus the word \"orange\" does not refer to a single color (any more than 3.14 refers to
            a
            single number), but rather refers to the gamut of colors between red and yellow. If we
            narrow this gamut by speaking of \"yellow-orange,\" we still are referring to an
            infinite
            number of colors. And we could make the gamut narrower by referring to \"orange
            yellow-orange\" or to \"yellow yellow-orange,\" thus bisecting the previous gamut. This
            process could be continued indefinitely, just as the value of π can be carried to more
            decimal places. The value, however, of carrying either very far is not large.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have been talking about rainbows, numbers, and space-time in order
            to establish
            what we mean by a continuum. Now we can define the term in the sense that we shall use
            it in discussing history. \"A continuum is a heterogeneous unity each point of which
            differs from all the surrounding points but differs from them by such subtle gradations
            in any one respect that no boundaries exist in the unity itself, and it can be divided
            into parts only by imaginary and arbitrary boundaries.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might add that some continua are perfect while others are highly
            imperfect, the
            distinction being that a perfect continuum has an infinite number of gradations between
            any two boundaries drawn in it, no matter how closely together they are drawn, while an
            imperfect continuum has a finite number of gradations between at least some of the
            boundaries drawn in the continuum. For example, the gamut of variations of light
            intensity during any twenty-four-hour period is a perfect continuum. But the \"races\"
            of
            mankind, however defined, are an imperfect continuum. For the variations in any standard
            we set as a criterion for race can be no more numerous than the number of individual
            human persons on the earth (that is, no more than a few billion variations) instead of
            the infinite number we expect to find in a perfect continuum. If, for example, we set
            color of skin as the criterion of \"race,\" and we were to arrange the human beings on
            the
            globe in some magical fashion in a long line with the blackest black man at one end and,
            next to him, the second blackest man, and so on, in ascending order of light reflection
            from their skin surfaces, until we passed through all the blacks, browns, reds, yellows,
            and whites to end up with the whitest white man on the globe, possibly an albino
            Norwegian—if we were to do this, I feel confident there would be no place on that long
            line where any two adjacent persons would have any difference in skin color sufficient
            to be distinguished by any normal physical process. We might then decide that men, based
            on skin color, form a single race. Or, if we insist on having more than one race, we
            might simply divide the line at its midpoint and settle for two races—the \"lights\" and
            the \"darks.\" But however many races we decided upon, there would be no discernible
            difference in skin color between any two adjacent persons between whom we drew a
            boundary line. Nevertheless, in the final analysis, this range of skin color would
            represent an imperfect continuum, because the variation of skin color between any two
            boundary lines or in the range of mankind as a whole would be numerable and not
            infinite.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might, on the other hand, arrange mankind in a line on the basis of
            height. In that
            case we would have several billion variations over a total height difference of no more
            than seven or eight feet, giving an average difference between any two adjacent persons
            of no more than one fifty-millionth of an inch, a difference which is, once again, too
            slight to be discernible by any normal procedures and is, indeed, considerably less than
            the normal increase and decrease of any one person\'s height caused by rest and exercise
            during a day. Indeed, if we tried to arrange the persons of the world in order by height
            we would find the daily changes in individual height to be relatively so much greater
            than the average height differences between individuals that persons would be compelled,
            from their constantly changing heights, to change their positions in the line by
            hundreds of thousands and even millions of persons at relatively short intervals. If we
            were to use such a criterion as height as a measure of race, we could do so only so long
            as people were locally segregated into groups of obviously different average heights. As
            soon as people began to move about or mix socially, the classification would break down.
            And we could never classify racially, on this basis, any isolated individual.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We deal with continua rationally either by dividing them into
            arbitrary intervals to
            which we give names, or by giving names to the two ends of the continuum and using these
            terms as if the middle ground did not exist at all. This last method is called
            \"polarizing a continuum,\" and is frequently done even when the greatest frequency of
            occurrence is in the middle range. When the telephone rings in the sorority house
            because someone wants a \"blind date,\" the sisters at once ask the vital question, \"Is
            he
            tall or short?\" They ask this question even though it is perfectly obvious that the
            majority of men are neither tall nor short but are nearer the middle range. Such
            polarization of continua is so common and so familiar that we come, frequently, to
            accept our categories as real instead of being arbitrary and imaginary, as they usually
            are. An accident report asks, \"Day or night?\" although accidents are most frequent
            when
            it is neither day nor night, but dusk. Many questionnaires polarize continua by asking
            us to check: \"White—Colored?\" \"Man—Woman?\" \"Pro—Con?\" In English law this is done
            in the
            distinctions between \"Adult—Juvenile\" or \"Sane— Insane.\" In the social sciences it
            is
            done in such contrasts as \"monopoly—competition\" in economics, \"democratic—
            authoritarian\" or \"totalitarian—liberal\" in politics. We have already done it several
            times in this book, as in the dichotomy between natural science and social science or
            between objective and subjective. The familiar polarization of man into spirit and flesh
            dominated religious ethics for centuries.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This practice of slicing continua into parts or even into dual poles
            and giving names
            to these artificial categories is necessary if we are to think about the world or to
            talk about it. But we must always remain alert to the danger of believing that our terms
            are real or refer to reality except by rough approximation. Only by making such
            divisions can we deal in a rational way with the many nonrational aspects of the world.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We could, of course, renounce any desire to deal with the world
            rationally and content
            ourselves with successful nonrational dealings with it. We can deal with the
            irrationality of space, time, quantity, number, race, color, and so forth, simply by
            action. Merely to walk, or to run like Achilles, is to deal with the irrationality of
            space and time and to discover, by action, who will win in a race. When we merely walk
            along, talking with our friends, we are, by walking, dealing successfully with space and
            time. No one could ever walk rationally. Simply stand still and make an effort to walk
            rationally. What is the first thing to do? And what should be done next? What messages
            must be given to which muscles and in what sequence? We do not know, and we could not do
            such a complicated mental operation quickly enough to walk by any rational thinking
            process.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we approach history, we are dealing with a conglomeration of
            irrational continua.
            Those who deal with history by nonrational processes are the ones who make history, the
            actors in it. But the historian must deal with history by rational processes.
            Accordingly, he must be aware of the processes and difficulties to which we have
            referred when we try to deal with continua rationally. For history deals with changes in
            society. And all changes, occurring in time, involve continua. Both society and culture
            are, even if static, concerned with continua. Indeed, a society is a continuum of
            continua in five dimensions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that a society or a civilization exists in five
            dimensions, we are
            referring to the fact that it exists in the three dimensions of space, the fourth
            dimension of time, and the fifth dimension of abstraction. All of these are easy to
            understand except the last. Let us look, for a moment, at this fifth dimension of
            abstraction. It is clear that every culture consists of concrete objects like clothes
            and weapons, of less tangible objects like emotions and feelings, and of quite abstract
            things like ideas. These form the dimension of abstraction. For example, in Western
            civilization we have such items as the following: (a) automobiles, (b) romantic love,
            (c) nationalism, (d) Beethoven\'s string quartets, and (e) the integral calculus. All of
            these are clearly products of Western civilization and could not have been produced by
            any other culture. They are of different degrees of abstractness and, accordingly, we
            can say that Western culture exists in a fifth dimension, the dimension of abstraction.
            This is the same dimension as the gamut of human needs to which we previously referred.
            However, it is wider than this gamut. It may be similarly divided into six levels, in a
            rough and approximate fashion. These divisions are arbitrary and imaginary, and even the
            order in which we list the levels is partly a matter of taste. These levels are, from
            the more abstract to the more concrete: (1) intellectual, (2) religious, (3) social, (4)
            economic, (5) political, and (6) military. Each of them could, if necessary, be
            subdivided into innumerable sublevels, as, for example, the economic into agriculture,
            commerce, and industry or into production, distribution and consumption. Such varied
            divisions and subdivisions are made possible by the fact that the reality is much more
            subtle and complex than are the categories of our thinking processes.

            passage of time. Thus:

            shall call \"development.\" Thus we may speak, for example, of the \"intellectual
            development\" or of the \"military development\" of a culture. The process of change on
            any
            single level we shall speak of as \"historical development\" (always remembering that

            few as we like, because the levels really merge into each other).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since the levels of culture arise from men\'s efforts to satisfy their
            human needs, we
            can say that every level has a purpose. Assuming the sixfold division we have made, we
            can speak of six basic human needs: (1) the need for group security, (2) the need to
            organize interpersonal power relationships, (3) the need for material wealth, (4) the
            need for companionship, (5) the need for psychological certainty, and (6) the need for
            understanding. To satisfy these needs, there come into existence on each level social
            organizations seeking to achieve these. These organizations, consisting largely of
            personal relationships, we shall call \"instruments\" as long as they achieve the
            purpose
            of the level with relative effectiveness. But every such social instrument tends to
            become an \"institution.\" This means that it takes on a life and purposes of its own
            distinct from the purpose of the level; in consequence, the purpose of that level is
            achieved with decreasing effectiveness. In fact, it can be stated as a rule of history
            that \"all social instruments tend to become institutions.\" The meaning of this rule
            will
            appear as we discuss its causes.

    <array name="content_4_2">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;An instrument is a social organization that is fulfilling effectively
            the purpose for
            which it arose. An institution is an instrument that has taken on activities and
            purposes of its own, separate from and different from the purposes for which it was
            intended. As a consequence, an institution achieves its original purposes with
            decreasing effectiveness. Every instrument consists of people organized in relationships
            to one another. As the instrument becomes an institution, these relationships become
            ends in themselves to the detriment of the ends of the whole organization. When people
            want their society to be defended, they create an organization called an army. This army
            consists of many persons with different duties. Each person takes as his purpose the
            fulfilling of his duties, but this soon leaves no one in the organization with the
            purpose of the organization as his primary purpose. The purpose of the organization—in
            this case, to defend the society—becomes no more than a secondary aim for everyone in
            the organization. Defense becomes secondary to discipline, keeping authority in
            channels, feeding and paying the troops, providing supplies or intelligence, and keeping
            visiting congressmen, or the people as a whole, happy about the army, the personal
            comforts of the soldiers, and so on. Moreover, as a second reason why every instrument
            becomes an institution, everyone in such an organization is only human and has human
            weakness and ambitions, or at least has the human proclivity to see things from an
            egocentric point of view. Thus, in every organization, persons begin to seek their own
            advancements or to act for their own advantages: seeking promotions, decorations,
            increases in pay, better or easier assignments; these begin to absorb more and more of
            the time and energies of the members of an organization. All of this reduces the time
            and energy devoted to the real goal of the organization and injures the general
            effectiveness with which an organization achieves its purposes. Finally, as a third
            reason why every instrument becomes an institution, the social conditions surrounding
            any such organization change in the course of time. When this happens the organization
            must be changed to adapt itself to the changed conditions or it will function with
            decreased effectiveness. But the members of any organization generally resist such
            change; they have become \"vested interests.\" Having spent long periods learning to do
            things in a certain way or with certain equipment, they find it difficult to persuade
            themselves that different ways of doing things with different equipment have become
            necessary; and, even if they do succeed in persuading themselves, they have considerable
            difficulty in training themselves to do things in a different way or to use different
            equipment.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Military history offers numerous examples of the institutionalization
            of instruments.
            The Roman army, which had conquered most of the known world by means of the legion, was
            unable, and probably unwilling, to transform itself into a force of heavily armed
            cavalry when this became necessary in the late fourth century of our era. As a result,
            the Roman army, and the civilization it was supposed to defend, were wiped from the
            earth by the charging horsemen of Germanic barbarians, beginning with the dreadful
            defeat at Adrianople in 378. The inability of fighting men to reorganize their ideas and
            their forces from infantry to cavalry was one of the vital factors in the replacement of
            pagan Classical civilization by Christian Western civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the centuries from A.D. 700 to 1200, cavalry in the form of the
            medieval knight
            became as established in military tactics as the Roman infantry had ever been. In 732
            the Saracens, whose relentless advance had begun in Arabia a century before, were
            defeated by the cavalry of Charles Martel at Tours, and the Christian West was saved
            from Moslem conquest. By 1099 the Western counterattack had reached in apex in the
            capture of Jerusalem. In the three century interval between these two victories,
            Germanic and Frankish cavalry, under Charlemagne, Otto the Great, and others, had saved
            Western culture from numerous pagan threats. Methods of fighting from horseback had
            become well established, almost formalized, and had begun to assume those chivalric
            embellishments that contributed so much to the institutionalization of this method of
            warfare. Noble youths, as we all know, spent years in jousting and tournaments to
            achieve the skill considered necessary for success on the field of battle.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The supremacy of the medieval knight was still unquestioned in the
            early decades of
            the fourteenth century. The defeat of French chivalry at the hands of bourgeois infantry
            before Courtrai in 1302 was dismissed by the losers as an inexplicable and unrepeatable
            accident. On the Celtic fringe of Britain, similar defeats at the hands of lower-class
            longbow men were more readily recognized for what they were, a new and successful
            tactic, and bowmen were incorporated into the English armies. By means of this
            innovation, English mercenary armies were able to inflict a series of disastrous defeats
            on French feudal forces in the century following the opening of the Hundred Years\' War
            in 1338. The inability of the French knights to analyze their defeats is one of the best
            examples we have of the reactions of an institutionalized force to weapons innovation.
            Of the numerous blinders on their eyes, the most significant perhaps was their inability
            to conceive that men of low birth could kill men of noble blood from a distance. A
            similar inability, in the same period, made it impossible for the noble cavalry of
            Burgundy and of the Hapsburgs to analyze their defeats at the hands of Swiss pikemen.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The advent of gunpowder and the intensification of firepower made
            cavalry obsolescent
            in the early nineteenth century and obsolete before the end of that century, yet by 1900
            cavalrymen were still dominant in many armies and enormous resources were devoted to an
            army that was, by that time, largely worthless. As early as the Crimean War (1854-56)
            the poet Tennyson saw that it was a blunder to send cavalry charging against gunfire.
            The American Civil War should have shown clearly the demise of offensive cavalry and
            even the fraudulent nature of its claim that it was, at least, \"the eyes of the army.\"
            Yet the post-war reminiscences of officers were filled with the exploits, largely based
            on institutionalized self-deception, of military men. Reviewing some of these
            reminiscences, in its issue of October 31, 1868, the Army and Navy Journal said: \"The
            day of the saber is over. The late civil war in America, which taught so much both in
            military and naval science, made it manifest that cavalry as cavalry had finished its
            work. Already fifty years before, at Waterloo, the havoc made in the matchless \'Old
            Guard,\' the consummation and ideal of cavalry, by the English infantry, had destroyed
            the prestige of heavy cavalry on the actual battlefield. But since then, the perfection
            of rifled arms, both in infantry and artillery weapons, has made its downfall absolute.
            It is a question of shock against shock; and, with \'modern arms of precision,\' a
            compact
            body of infantry can empty every saddle in a charging squadron before it arrives to
            where sabers can be used.\" Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that firepower, as
            these words were written, had also condemned any \"compact body of infantry,\" we must
            emphasize the fact that these remarks on the role of cavalry went largely unheeded in
            military circles. By the end of the century cavalrymen, in all armies except the French
            and the Germans, were organizing, both formally and informally, to maintain the role of
            cavalry in military forces and to secure promotions for fellow cavalrymen.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The talent \"experts\" have for seeing what they expect to see or what
            they are trained
            to see rather than what is there to see is nowhere better shown than in the tactical
            discussions preceding World War I. In giving evidence before the Royal Commission on the
            [Boer] War in South Africa, that intrepid cavalryman Douglas Haig announced firmly,
            \"Cavalry will have a larger sphere of action in future wars.\" That was in 1904.
            Fourteen
            years later, as British commander in chief in France (having succeeded in that post
            another cavalryman, Sir John French), Haig had to cooperate with the commander in chief
            of the American Expeditionary Force, also a cavalry general, John Pershing. Pershing\'s
            obsession with the importance of cavalry made it necessary for him to carry on two wars,
            one against the Germans and another, almost equally virulent, against Peyton C. March,
            Chief of Staff in Washington. Much of this struggle, in which Pershing, as a public
            hero, was generally successful, was concerned with the control of transatlantic shipping
            space, which Pershing wanted to utilize for horses and fodder, while March sought to
            reserve it for men and ammunition.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In an analysis of this problem in 1935, the military historian Liddell
            Hart wrote:
            \"French, Germans, Russians, and Austrians had unexampled masses of cavalry ready at the
            outbreak of war. But in the opening phase they caused more trouble to their own sides
            than to the enemy. From 1915 on, their effect was trivial, except as a strain on their
            own country\'s supplies: despite the relatively small number of British cavalry, forage
            was the largest item of supplies sent overseas, exceeding even ammunition, and thus the
            most dangerous factor in aggravating the submarine menace; while by authoritative
            verdict, the transport trouble caused in feeding the immense number of cavalry horses
            was an important factor in producing the Russian collapse.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Nor does the story of cavalry complete the picture of how military
            institutions
            distort men\'s picture of reality to the injury of their stated aims. A more significant
            and more frightful example is to be seen in the bayonet. This steely blade was made
            obsolete by increased firepower almost as rapidly as the cavalry\'s saber, yet the
            change
            went equally unobserved by most experts. In fact, the cause of the obsolescence of both
            saber and bayonet, the great increase in firepower, especially from machine guns, went
            equally unobserved. According to the book, as taught in military schools and training
            manuals, victory in battle was achieved by methods perfected by Napoleon, as analyzed by
            Clausewitz (1780-1831). On this basis orthodox expertise established that victory was to
            be achieved by the three successive stages of artillery barrage, bayonet assault with
            infantry, and cavalry pursuit with saber. To this, near the end of the nineteenth
            century, the Frenchman Charles Ardant du Picq added the murderous addendum that all
            three of these stages were really secondary to morale. General Ferdinand Foch, for many
            years in charge of advanced training of French officers, entrenched these professional
            and erroneous views by reporting, from his on-the-field studies of the Russian- Japanese
            War of 1904-05, that machine-gun fire would not reduce the effectiveness of bayonet
            charges.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A third example of institutionalized thinking in military tactics in
            this period might
            be called the doctrine of the \"straight front.\" According to the book, the worst error
            a
            commander could make would be to allow his unit to be cut off from his line of supplies
            and to be caught in a \"crossfire.\" To avoid these errors, it was \"imperative\" to
            advance
            with a straight front against the enemy, even if this required holding back the advance
            at defensively weak spots and throwing reserves at the enemy\'s strong points. Simply by
            reversing this rule in March 1918 (by advancing as rapidly as possible and by throwing
            reserves at the defensive weak points, thus bypassing and isolating his strong points),
            Erich von Ludendorff made the most spectacular advances of the war, bursting over Chemin
            des Dames and being stopped finally, ten weeks later, thirty-four miles from Paris
            —stopped because he could not bring himself to use his unorthodox methods with full
            conviction and resources.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a consequence of the institutionalization of military tactics by
            devotion to the
            bayonet, the saber, and the straight front, the early years of World War I saw the
            largest casualties in history, suffered, in most cases, to advance over a few miles of
            devastated terrain. In the early months of 1916 almost a million casualties were
            suffered by both sides in a single battle (Verdun), while later in the same year another
            battle (Somme) cost 1,200,000 casualties, mostly by bayonet charges against machine-gun
            fire. When civilians in England tried to force the professional soldiers to use the
            tank, or civilians in Germany tried to make the professionals use poison gas against
            machine guns, both were resisted bitterly. When the civilians succeeded in ordering the
            military to use these innovations, their use was sabotaged by the soldiers. The refusal
            of the British Command, in 1915, to yield to civilian requests to shift their munition
            orders from ineffective shrapnel to high-explosive shells for barrages against trench
            defenses led to an acute intragovernmental crisis that gave impetus to the rise of David
            Lloyd George. In the American army of 1918 a major part of training time was devoted to
            bayonet practice. As late as 1940 this was still true, although in the interval the
            casualty statistics of World War I had shown that the casualty figures from bayonet
            wounds were microscopic. Non-commissioned officers, skilled in bayonet tactics, were
            reluctant to abandon something that they knew and could teach, and justified their
            inertia, in spite of the statistics, on the grounds of the presumed morale-raising
            attributes of cold steel. From experiences such as these, the French premier, Georges
            Clemenceau, drew the conclusion that \"war is far too important to ever be entrusted to
            soldiers.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Clemenceau might well have broadened his remark to say that everything
            is too
            important ever to be entrusted to professional experts, because every organization of
            such professionals and every established social organization becomes a vested-interest
            institution more concerned with its efforts to maintain itself or advance its own
            interests than to achieve the purpose that society expects it to achieve. As a
            consequence, old established armies and navies have frequently been defeated by new
            forces that have not yet become institutionalized. Thus the Greeks defeated the
            Persians; the new Roman navy defeated the Carthaginian fleet; the English defeated the
            French chivalry in the Hundred Years\' War; the English navy, barely seventy-five years
            old, defeated the Spanish Armada; Braddock was defeated; the Colonists won the American
            Revolution; the new French armies of Napoleon defeated the old, bedecorated forces of
            Austria and Prussia; the new Prussian army of Emil von Roon and Helmuth von Moltke
            defeated Austria and France in 1866 and 1870; the Boers held off the English for years;
            and Japan defeated Russia in 1905. Such defeats can be avoided only by constant reform
            that seeks to reorganize an institutionalized force so that its aim—to defeat the enemy
            —remains always paramount.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This situation appears in every social organization. Workers join
            together to get
            better pay and working conditions. The organizations they form, labor unions, soon take
            on a life of their own, and the workers begin to wonder if they are not now as much the
            slaves of the union as formerly they were slaves of the management. The kings of
            England, long ago, created a representative assembly to consent to taxation. Soon that
            assembly (Parliament) took on life of its own and ended by decapitating, removing, and
            ruling kings. A political party was organized in 1854 to protect freedom in the United
            States and to prevent the extension of slavery. By 1868 it was an organized machine of
            vested interests, a functioning spoils system, whose chief aim was to perpetuate itself
            in office and whose chief method for achieving that aim was to end the freedom of the
            whites in the South. A church is organized to bring men psychological security by
            linking them with the Deity. A century later it has become a vested institution with
            wealth and power, and its chief aim is to preserve and expand these valuable
            prerogatives. A college is organized to train youth in practical and humane
            achievements; later it has become a whole tissue of vested interests in which standards
            are lowered and admission qualifications relaxed in order to secure a flow of tuitions
            that go to meet the institution\'s expenses. Within its hallowed walls, professors
            intrigue for promotions and appointments for themselves and their disciples, while a
            condition of undeclared war goes on between departments and schools to get larger
            student enrollments in their courses and thus justify bigger slices from the annual
            university budget. Even in earlier days, professors of the classics resisted efforts to
            reduce required Latin from four years to two, or to make Greek completely elective, or
            to abolish compulsory chapel, or to establish a first (elective) course in chemistry
            without any efforts at any objective analysis of the purposes of these activities or of
            their role in training youth for later life; that these changes would reduce the
            established system\'s control of the college was, in most cases, a sufficient argument
            to
            oppose change.

            A game called football was invented about 1870 to provide healthful physical exercise
            for the undergraduates on bright autumn afternoons. Seventy years later the
            undergraduates who needed exercise most were seated in the stands of a city baseball
            park on Friday night, with their flasks and their coeds, while on the grass (or mud)
            below, the undergraduates who needed exercise least pushed each other about under the
            floodlights.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The process by which football was, almost imperceptibly, transformed
            from an
            instrument for providing physical exercise to an institution acting as an obstacle to
            exercise for many students who loved the game and needed the exercise is as instructive
            an example of social development as changes in military tactics. The informal games of
            the 1860s and early 1870s between groups from the same campus led, little by little, to
            challenges for games with other institutions. This led to travel expenses, more
            formalized rules, nonpartisan officials, and uniforms. The increase in interest led to
            larger groups of spectators. What could be more natural than to pass a hat among these
            spectators to raise money for the players\' expenses? Defeats led to desire for revenge,
            and thus to stricter rules of team membership, practice, and training. All of this led
            gradually to more formalized coaching. This task rested at first with the captain and
            more experienced players, but, as established intercollegiate rivalries began to grow,
            an experienced player of previous years, usually the last victorious captain, was asked
            to return from the outside world to coach intensively during the week before the \"big
            game.\" As other colleges adopted this pattern and several \"big games\" a year emerged,
            the demands on graduates to return to the campus for coaching duty became more than
            could be fulfilled. The obvious solution, a full-time paid coach, made it essential to
            have an established team income. \"Passing the hat\" among the spectators was replaced
            by
            sales of tickets at a fixed price. But sold tickets entitled spectators to a seat, which
            led very quickly to the building of the first modern stadium (1903). In time stadiums
            were being built with borrowed funds, with the result that their mortgage charges, along
            with coaches\' salaries and other expenses, made it essential that the stadium\'s seats,
            no matter how numerous, must be filled, or nearly filled, on the eight or so Saturdays a
            year it was used.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Gradually the interests of the spectators and the need for football
            income became
            dominant over the interests of any undergraduate who liked football or needed exercise.
            The team had to win, at least most of the time, and the game had to be spectacular to
            watch. Scouts looked for able players outside and, in one way or another, persuaded them
            to come to the scout\'s college to play football. Financial rewards proved, in many
            cases, to be powerful persuaders. Thus the game shifted from undergraduates who needed
            exercise to those who had already had too much exercise. At some institutions, where
            football incomes were earmarked for educational uses such as for building funds, almost
            all games were played in baseball parks of large cities remote from the campus, with the
            result that the team could rarely be seen by its own students. Teams that played on the
            East Coast, the West Coast, and the Gulf Coast on successive weekends spent much of the
            autumn traveling and might be away from their college halls for weeks.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When the depression cut attendance in the early 1930s, many games were
            scheduled in
            the evening to attract working spectators. For the same purpose the rules were
            manipulated to give more open play, high scores, and superiority to the offense. By
            reducing the diameter of the ball, it was made easier to pass and harder to kick, in the
            belief that spectators preferred passing. Restrictions on passing requiring a minimum
            distance behind the scrimmage line for the passer or penalizing successive incompleted
            passes were removed. To keep the ball moving on offense, the referee was instructed to
            move the ball in fifteen yards from the side lines when it became dead closer than that
            distance from the sides. At no point in this process did many persons stop to ask
            themselves, \"What is the purpose of football anyway?\" But those who look at
            football\'s
            ninety years of development can see quite clearly how an organization which originally
            rose as an instrument for undergraduate exercise had become something quite different,
            to the jeopardy of undergraduate exercise.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process, which we call the institutionalization of instruments,
            is found in
            almost all social phenomena. The purpose of music, I suppose, is to provide pleasure
            from sounds. Various notes are combined together for this purpose and are thus a medium
            for achieving the purpose of music. But if the same combinations are much used and long
            continued, they cease to provide pleasure and even cease to be heard. They become
            \"banal.\" New combinations of sound are devised, usually over the objections of the
            academician defenders of the older banal combinations who call the innovations
            \"dissonance\" or even \"discord.\" But soon the new combinations become accepted, give
            pleasure, and after much use become banal. They have become institutionalized. Later
            students, looking back over the development of music, frequently wonder what all the
            excitement was about. It is difficult for us today to hear the \"dissonance\" that
            contemporaries heard in Mozart; we even have some trouble hearing the \"discords\" with
            which Stravinsky so shocked the musical world in 1913.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A similar process can be seen in painting, sculpture, architecture,
            drama, opera,
            poetry and, indeed, in most human activities. Works that caused riots at their debuts,
            like Hugo\'s Hernani or Eliot\'s Prufrock, leave us cold or only slightly moved. They
            have
            reached a condition equivalent to music\'s banality. Expressions that were vivid,
            concrete, evocative, and thus \"poetical\" when first used become \"prosaic.\" The
            expression \"Let us get under weigh,\" which once would recall a full-sail vessel
            getting
            under the weight of its anchor and thus off to sea, has now become so lacking in these
            poetic qualities that editors, proofreaders, and even H. W. Fowler insist on spelling
            \"weigh\" as \"way.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There is of course nothing particularly original in the statement that
            organizations
            begin with devotion to a purpose and somehow along the way get turned from that purpose
            and gradually become a collection of special interests. The historians of religion
            frequently point out this process by distinguishing between \"religion\" and
            \"clericalism.\" To escape this transformation, the Quakers renounced all organizational
            features, but it can hardly be said that they have been successful in escaping
            completely from what seems to be an inevitable process of change. Thorstein Veblen
            devoted much of his analysis of our economic system to a similar process which he
            contrasted by such dichotomies as industry versus business, workmanship versus vested
            interests, or the engineers versus the price system.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The process of which we speak was generalized by Charles Peguy in
            Notre Jeunesse when
            he said, \"Everything begins as mystique and ends up as politique.\'\'\'\' In his own
            experience he had seen the idealism and broad humanitarianism of the original
            Dreyfusards gradually transformed into the selfish grasping at political power of the
            Combes ministry. The experience seared his idealistic soul to the point where he
            welcomed death from German guns in 1914. Fortunately for the survival of mankind most of
            us are not so sensitive as Peguy, for the institutionalization of social instruments is
            the most widespread of historical phenomena, and no observant person can fail to notice
            it. We shall point out many examples of this process in the rest of this volume.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When instruments become institutions, as they all do, the organization
            achieves its
            function or purpose in society with decreasing effectiveness, and discontent with its
            performance begins to rise, especially among outsiders. These discontented suggest
            changes, which they call reforms, just as we see happening in American elementary and
            secondary education today. When these suggestions are not accepted or are rejected by
            the established groups who control the criticized organization, conflicts and
            controversies begin, the discontented seeking to change the organization, while the
            vested interests seek to maintain their accustomed methods of operation. While all good
            or all wrong is never entirely on one side in such controversies, discontent and
            controversy are unlikely to rise to any important level unless the organization is well
            institutionalized and considerably less effective than the society as a whole expects.
            Accordingly, when this degree of discontent is reached, the vested-interest groups are
            generally tending to defend a relatively ineffective system and the \"reformers\" are,
            among many mistakes, generally advocating measures that would increase the
            organization\'s relative effectiveness in achieving its social purpose.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The strain between the two groups engaged in a struggle such as this
            will be called,
            in this book, \"the tension of development.\" From this tension and its ensuing
            controversy, there may emerge any one (or combination) among three possible outcomes:
            reform, circumvention, or reaction. In the first case, reform, the institution is
            reorganized and its methods of action changed so that it becomes, relatively speaking,
            more of an instrument and achieves its purpose with sufficient facility to reduce
            tension to a socially acceptable level. In the second case, circumvention, the
            institution is left with most of its privileges and vested interests intact, but its
            duties are taken away and assigned to a new instrument within the same society. This
            second method is much used by the English. The king was left covered with honors, but
            the task of governing England was taken over by Parliament and ultimately by a committee
            of Parliament. The Lord Warden of the Cinq Ports has a brilliant uniform and a drafty
            castle, but the task of guarding the seas of England was given to the Royal Navy in the
            sixteenth century. The Earl Marshal of England is left with titles and social prestige
            and still manages the coronation, but the job of leading the army was given to a
            commander in chief. In the period before the tenth century, when Europe needed defense,
            an organization called feudalism grew up to provide this need, and performed its task so
            well that European culture was preserved from the assaults of the Saracens, the pagan
            Germans, and the eastern raiders. In fact, feudalism performed its task so well that by
            1100 Europe was mounting that counterassault that we call the Crusades. But within three
            hundred years, feudalism had become a vested institution of hereditary privileges and
            emoluments. It was circumvented by creating in the society a new organization, called
            the Royal Army, to which the task of defense was given. The privileged vested interests
            of feudalism were neither reformed nor abolished but were left as a structure of honor
            and rewards that we call chivalry and the hereditary nobility.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the third possible outcome, reaction, the vested interests triumph
            in the struggle,
            and the people of that society are doomed to ineffective achievement of their needs on
            that level for an indefinite period. The agrarian system of ancient Rome was an
            inefficient method of producing food even in respect of the existing technical
            knowledge, but to reform it would have involved abolition of slavery and division of the
            large estates. The reformers who wanted to do this were assassinated by the daggers of
            the landlords, some on the floor of the senate itself. As a result, the economic needs
            of the Roman system could be met only by the use of other levels, especially by military
            conquest and by political exploitation of conquered provinces. But in time, both the
            political and the military organizations became ineffective vested institutions. The
            result was civil war and eventual conquest by outside barbarians.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When an institution has been reformed or circumvented, there is once
            again an
            instrument on the level in question, and the purpose of that level is achieved with
            relative effectiveness. But, once again, as always happens, the new instrument becomes
            an institution, effectiveness decreases, tension of development rises, and conflict
            appears. If the outcome of this conflict is either reform or circumvention,
            effectiveness increases and tension decreases. If the outcome is reaction,
            ineffectiveness becomes chronic and tension remains high.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a result of this process of historical development, the development
            of each level
            appears in history as a pulsating movement. Periods of economic prosperity alternate
            with periods of economic stagnation; periods of religious or intellectual satisfaction
            alternate with periods of religious or intellectual frustration. Periods of political
            order or military success alternate with periods of political disorder or military
            disaster.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process of historical development takes place on innumerable
            levels of a society
            because there are innumerable levels to the culture. But this process is only one aspect
            of the historical evolution of a society. The other aspect we call historical
            morphology; it is concerned with the relationships between the different levels of
            culture in a society. Before we examine it, we might state, in a formal way, three
            definitions:
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;1. Historical development is concerned with the changes that take
            place on any single
            level of culture in a society.\n
            2. Historical morphology is concerned with the ways in which one level of culture
            influences the other levels of culture in the same society.\n
            3. Historical evolution is a resultant of historical development and historical
            morphology, both acting simultaneously and reacting on each other.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;\"Morphology\" is a word borrowed from biology. It means that the
            parts of a living
            organism are adapted to one another. In its most obvious sense it means that a giraffe
            could not possibly have the neck of an elephant nor could an elephant have the legs of a
            giraffe. But it also has a more subtle meaning. When we speak of a heavyweight boxer we
            frequently mention his \"best fighting weight.\" This means that, given his height,
            reach,
            age, experience, and all the rest of his specifications, there is an optimum weight for
            his best fighting ability. If he is over that weight, he is slowed up; if he is under
            that weight, his blows lack impact. On the other hand, if he is at his best fighting
            weight, there is also an optimum length for his arms or an optimum height. If his reach
            or his height varies by much from these optimum points, his fighting ability will
            suffer. All of these are morphological relationships.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The same kinds of morphological relationships appear in a society. The
            ability of a
            society to defend itself on the military level is dependent on its ability to provide
            domestic order on the political level, wealth on the economic level, companionship on
            the social level, understanding on the intellectual level, and psychic certainty on the
            religious level. At the same time the ability of the society to defend itself affects
            its ability to achieve these five other goals. Thus each level is closely connected with
            all the others. It would be quite impossible to support a mechanized army without a
            fairly centralized political system, without a highly industrialized economic system, or
            without a fairly active scientific tradition on the intellectual level. On the other
            hand, a military system like feudalism, in which men fought as trained specialists on
            horseback, could be supported by a completely decentralized political system (in which
            there was no state at all) or by a purely agricultural economic system, and with an
            intellectual system which emphasized honor and loyalty rather than knowledge or science.
            Such a system existed in Western Europe about the year 1100, just as the system
            indicated in the preceding sentence exists in Europe in the twentieth century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Just as there is an optimum length for a giraffe\'s neck (given all
            his other
            measurements as fixed), and just as there is a best fighting weight or a best length of
            reach for a heavyweight boxer (given all his other measurements as fixed), so also there
            is an optimum point of development on each level of culture (assuming all the other
            levels have reached fixed points of development). This optimum point for each level in
            relationship to the development of each other level is the point at which morphological
            tension is least. This means that time and energy on each level can be devoted to
            achieving the purpose of each level and need not be used up in interlevel friction
            because of the need to speed up the development of another level; nor need such energy
            and time be used in any one level in amounts beyond that which would be required to
            attain a certain degree of achievement on that level because of the inadequacies of some
            other level. For example, if the point of development of the political level is
            morphologically inadequate, more time and energy must be expended on the economic or the
            military level to achieve a certain amount of production or protection from these
            levels. All this is really nothing more than a rewording of our previous statement that
            culture is integrative. And just as we said, at that time, that culture never gets
            integrated and that it would be a bad thing if it did, so we can say here that
            morphological tension never reaches zero and that it would be a bad thing if it did (for
            then the society would be rigidly frozen into an unchanging pattern and would perish).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We can picture this somewhat more clearly with the aid of a diagram.
            In this diagram
            we shall mark, very roughly, the point which we believe our Western society has reached
            on each of the six levels of culture:

        <item>Imageimage_4_4_63</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Each of these points is a very rough estimate because each represents
            the resultant of
            a large number of sublevels. For example, the point we have indicated on the
            Intellectual Level represents the resultants of a very advanced science, a very backward
            art, a fairly mediocre humanities, and other factors. The backwardness of our religious
            development or of our social developments represents the widespread frustration of these
            human needs, the low level of our appreciation of the nature of deity, the widespread
            failure to establish any feeling of relationship between this deity and man\'s spiritual
            life and, on the social level, the widespread frustration of men\'s gregarious needs in
            a
            society built on great cities, millions of unrecognized faces in those cities, and a
            general lack of established, satisfying social relationships.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The advanced point indicated on the economic and military levels
            indicates the
            extraordinary success we have had in producing wealth and in directing power against
            outside societies. Our amazingly high standards of living are proof of the advanced
            status of the economic level, while the numbers of outside societies that we have
            destroyed (from the American Indians and the Australian aborigines to Mandarin China or
            Mogul India) are witness to our success on the military level. The advanced states of
            both of these levels are largely due to the even further advanced state of our
            intellectual level. The fact that the latter is still in advance of the economic or
            military level means that its morphological influence on them is still tending to pull
            them forward. On the other hand, the backwardness of these two levels (and, indeed, of
            the three others as well) in relationship to the intellectual level is tending to hold
            the development of this last level back. Thus each level acts upon all the others.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The backwardness of our religious and social developments is
            undoubtedly holding back
            the development of the intellectual and political levels. At the same time, the
            relatively advanced state of the intellectual, economic, and military developments of
            our society is forcing the political development forward, while the backwardness of the
            political level has a tendency to hold the developments on the military, economic, and
            intellectual levels back. The backwardness of one level of development in respect of
            other levels of development is widely recognized among students of society, and is
            called \"cultural lag.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the specific case we have just mentioned (the cultural lag of the
            political level),
            we are also dealing with a widely recognized fact. Our political organization, based as
            it is on an eighteenth-century separation of powers and on a nineteenth- century
            nationalist state, is generally recognized to be semi obsolete. We hear demands for a
            \"European federation\" or for a \"twentieth-century Congress.\" The breakdown of the
            separation of powers is evident in the rapid growth of administrative regulation (which
            disregards such separation). The need to adapt the United States Constitution to the
            speed of communication of the twentieth century is evident in the Twentieth Amendment,
            which moved the inauguration date up from March 4 to January 20. The need for further
            adaptation is clear from the fact that the American Congress still spends hours of its
            inadequate time on verbal roll-call votes when it could make a permanent record vote by
            electricity in a few seconds. The power of vested institutionalism is evident in
            congressional resistance to a reform that would force congressmen to make a public
            record of their positions on each bill.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;One last example of morphological interrelationships, and that the
            most extreme, could
            be found in the relationship of the atomic bomb to Western civilization. This bomb was a
            product of our advanced development on the intellectual, economic, and military levels.
            The fact that this great discovery of atomic fission was used for a purely destructive
            purpose is due to the backwardness of our religious, social, and political levels. But
            the advanced condition of certain levels, as signified by the bomb, has undoubtedly had
            profound influences on the three more backward levels and will force them to advance
            more rapidly. There can be little doubt that the advent of atomic warfare on the
            military level has had profound effects and will have even more profound effects on the
            three backward levels. People are, in consequence of its use, turning again to the
            problem of religion or the inadequacy of our political development. The decentralization
            of our cities is a process already clearly evident from such forces as improved
            communications (telephone) and transportation (automobiles), and is reflected in the
            growth of suburbs and the decrease in metropolitan growth; if the atom bomb speeds up
            this process, it will probably lead to a considerable advance on the social level. As
            people disperse from the great beehives of modern cities to the more intimate living of
            the suburbs and countryside, there will undoubtedly be a considerable improvement in the
            satisfaction of men\'s needs for companionship on this social level.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Even in our oversimplified diagram of six levels, it is clear that the
            process of
            morphology is a complex one. There are thirty-six interrelationships between the six
            levels we have, and, since each relationship works both ways, there are seventy-two
            factors at work. But when we remember that the divisions between these levels are
            arbitrary and imaginary and that really there are an infinite number of levels, each
            acting upon all the others, pulling these others forward or backward and being pulled
            backward or forward in turn, it is clear that the reality of cultural morphology is
            unbelievably complex. The number of factors at work with an infinite number of levels is
            infinity raised to the infinite power and multiplied by two. This is a number large
            enough for anyone.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;What happens in a society as a whole, what we called \"historical
            evolution,\" is a
            resultant of historical development and morphology acting both independently and upon
            each other. If a level of development is going through the process of development that
            we have described—the process of institutionalization of instruments with growing
            tension —the outcome of such tension, as between reform, circumvention, and reaction,
            may well be determined by morphological factors. A level, regarded as if it were alone,
            may have all the factors necessary to produce reform. But the influence of morphology
            may produce reaction. Something like this occurred in Spain in the period 1930-40.
            There, all the factors on the political level seemed to be leading toward reform, but
            the backwardness of the five other levels and the great power of the institutionalized
            vested interests on those five other levels turned political reform into political
            reaction.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is clear that every civilization undergoes a process of historical
            change. We can
            see that a civilization comes into existence, passes through a long experience, and
            eventually goes out of existence. We know, for example, that Mesopotamian civilization
            did not exist about 10,000 B.C.; it did exist about 3000 B.C.; it had ceased to exist by
            A.D. 1000. Similarly, it is clear that Classical civilization did not exist about 1500
            B.C.; it clearly did exist about 500 B.C.; and it had obviously passed out of existence
            by A.D. 1000. And, finally, it is clear that Western civilization did not exist about
            A.D. 500; it did exist in full flower about A.D. 1500; and it will surely pass out of
            existence at some time in the future, perhaps before A.D. 2500. Now, while everyone will
            probably agree with all this, it would be difficult to obtain agreement on any specific
            dates on which these events occurred. This difficulty arises from the fact that
            civilizations come into existence, rise and flourish, and go out of existence by a slow
            process which covers decades or even centuries, and historians are unable to agree on
            any precise dates for these events. This is perfectly proper: if Classical civilization
            came into existence by a slow process and went out of existence by a slow process, it
            would give a false appearance of rigidity to fix its dates, say at 1184 B.C.-A.D. 476,
            as has sometimes been done. In the following discussion it should be remembered that the
            dates given for historical periods are only approximate.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Beyond recognizing that civilizations begin and end, historians are
            fairly well agreed
            that, after they begin, they flourish and grow for a while, that eventually they reach a
            peak of power and prosperity, and that they weaken and decay before their final end.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process of evolution of civilizations can only be studied in an
            effective fashion
            if we divide it into a number of consecutive periods. We might divide it into two
            periods, such as \"rise\" and \"decline\"; we might divide it into three periods, such
            as
            \"youth,\" \"maturity,\" and \"old age\"; or we might divide it into five or fifty
            periods.
            The process of change in the history of any civilization is a continuum and,
            accordingly, the periods into which we may divide it are arbitrary and imaginary. Thus,
            it might be argued that one system of periodization is as good as another and,
            accordingly, we are free to divide it in any way that seems to fit our purpose at the
            moment. To some extent this is true, as long as we are aware that our periods are
            subjective, but necessary, divisions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;However, it is not completely true that one periodization is as good
            as another,
            although any system of periodization may well be useful for some specific purpose.
            Obviously, periodization must depend on changes in the society\'s culture. And, equally
            obviously, changes in a culture must depend on the causes of these changes. Accordingly,
            the periodization should, ideally, depend on the causes of the culture changes. This
            rule has been consistently neglected in all discussion of this subject. Writers tell us
            that a civilization rises and falls; they divide this process into periods, and they
            sometimes try to explain why it rises and falls; but they rarely relate their periods of
            the process of change to their explanation of the causes of the change.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The most popular explanation of the causes of historical change and
            especially of the
            rise and fall of civilizations has been by means of some biological analogy in which a
            people, once young and vigorous, were softened and weakened by rising standards of
            living, or by a loss of the ideology of hard work and self-sacrifice that had made their
            rise possible. In most cases little or no effort has been made to correlate this process
            of change with the various stages through which the civilization was said to have
            passed. In some cases this \"softening of fiber\" theory has been presented in a more
            naive form by a simple biological analogy in which civilizations, like man himself, were
            felt to pass through a simple sequence of youth, maturity, and old age. In many cases no
            real explanation of the process of change has been given at all, the theorists in
            question being satisfied with attaching names to the various stages of historical
            change. Giovanni Battista Vico, for example, saw the history of each people as a process
            by which barbarian vigor slowly developed into rationalism, the period of greatest
            success being merely the middle period when the two qualities of vigor and rationality
            were in a fruitful, precarious, and temporary balance, while the decline was due to the
            final triumph of rationalism over energy. In the late nineteenth century, as biological
            sciences became more influential, these basic ideas were reserved with varying
            quantities of biological sauces. The Russian thinker Nikolai Danilevsky attributed the
            earlier period of vigor to biologic mixture of peoples, and attributed the intermediate
            ages of greatest achievement to the rise of a state organization that could direct such
            energies into more productive channels. The final stage of decay is not clearly
            explained but seems to be attributed to some process of political institutionalization
            not too remote from the explanation offered here.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, the
            influences of Darwinian
            thinking became dominant in theories of civilization dynamics. W. M. Flinders Petrie in
            1911 offered a Darwinian version of the theories of earlier writers such as Danilevsky:
            an earlier period of struggle, based on the vigorous energy of barbarian intruders, was
            gradually weakened by the enjoyment of rising standards of living which weakened
            \"strife.\" Enunciating the general rule, \"There is no advance without strife,\" Petrie
            pictured each cycle as an accelerating decay resulting from a decrease in \"strife.\"
            This
            point of view, generally accepted by many of the earlier theorists on this subject, saw
            the later stages of any civilization as a period of decreasing strife or violence, a
            conclusion which seems to be sharply at variance with the facts.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;To Oswald Spengler, one of the most famous of modern writers on this
            subject, a
            similar pattern was evident. He discerned in each people an earlier stage of vigorous
            creativity that he called \"culture\" and a later stage of weakening moral fiber and
            devotion to selfish physical comforts that he called \"civilization.\" As is usual among
            writers on this subject, no real explanation was provided for this loss of motion,
            although the pattern was applied to ten different \"cultures.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The most famous of recent writers on this subject, Arnold J. Toynbee,
            has produced the
            most voluminous and, in spite of its sprawling organization, most satisfactory theory of
            these processes. He is still strongly influenced by Darwinian biology, and attributes
            rise and fall of civilizations to the \"challenge and response\" to \"the struggle for
            existence.\" In spite of his many improvements over earlier writers, especially in
            regard
            to the units to which this pattern applies and the stages through which the pattern
            takes each unit, Toynbee\'s theories have several of the prevalent inadequacies of
            earlier writers, especially in his failure to correlate the stages of change with the
            process of change and, above all, in his failure to explain why a civilization which has
            been \"responding\" to \"challenges\" successfully for centuries gradually ceases to do
            so,
            and decays.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Most of the earlier writers derived their patterns from the study of a
            relatively few
            units, and generally based their interpretations very largely on the Greco-Roman
            experience in Classical antiquity. This reliance on the culture that most of us know
            best is, of course, to be expected, but has been unfortunate, since the pattern of rise
            and fall in Classical antiquity is not completely typical, as can be seen from the
            difficulty most writers have had in deciding whether the Greeks and Romans should be
            treated separately or together.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Vico derived his pattern from only two examples, Roman and Christian
            cultures, but
            most later writers had information, however vague, on a much greater number of cases.
            Many had no clear idea of the unit we call \"civilization,\" and they confused peoples,
            political units, societies, and even religions in an indiscriminate fashion, greatly
            increasing the difficulty of finding patterns of change. Danilevsky spoke of ten
            historical \"types,\" to which he added Russia as an eleventh in the future. In general
            his units were linguistic groupings, so that the Greeks and Romans were treated as
            separate units. Spengler also spoke of ten, but his units were different from
            Danilevsky\'s and were made very ambiguous in some cases by being based on spiritual
            outlooks, such as his famous conceptions of Apollonian (Classical), Faustian (Western),
            and Magian (post-Classical Near Eastern) cultures. Toynbee saw about two dozen
            civilizations, not much different from those accepted in this present book.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The pattern of change in civilizations presented here consists of
            seven stages
            resulting from the fact that each civilization has an instrument of expansion that
            becomes an institution. The civilization rises while this organization is an instrument
            and declines as this organization becomes an institution.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;By the term \"instrument of expansion\" we mean that the society must
            be organized in
            such fashion that three things are true: (1) the society must be organized in such a way
            that it has an incentive to invent new ways of doing things; (2) it must be organized in
            such a way that somewhere in the society there is accumulation of surplus—that is, some
            persons in the society control more wealth than they wish to consume immediately; and
            (3) it must be organized in such a way that the surplus which is being accumulated is
            being used to pay for or to utilize the new inventions. All three of these things are
            essential to any civilization. Taken together, we call them an instrument of expansion.
            If a producing society has such an organization (an instrument of expansion), we call it
            a civilization, and it passes through the process we are about to describe. Before we
            describe this process, however, we should be certain we understand the nature of an
            instrument of expansion.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The three essential parts of an instrument of expansion are incentive
            to invent,
            accumulation of surplus, and application of this surplus to the new inventions.
            Economists might call these three \"invention,\" \"saving,\" and \"investment,\" but the
            terms
            used by economists are generally so ambiguous to noneconomists that we hesitate to use
            them.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;\"Incentive to invent\" is sometimes difficult for students to grasp
            because they
            assume
            that all societies are equally inventive, or that \"necessity is the mother of
            invention,\" or that invention is somehow related to innate, hereditary biological
            talent
            (so that there are \"inventive races\" and \"noninventive races\"). None of these things
            is
            true. Some societies, like Mesopotamian civilization or our own Western civilization,
            are very inventive. Others, like many primitive tribes, or civilizations like the
            Egyptian, are very uninventive. Nor does \"necessity\" have much to do with
            inventiveness.
            If it did, those peoples who are pressed down upon the subsistence level, or even below
            it, in their standards of living, like some of the Indian tribes of the Matto Grosso,
            would be very inventive, which they are not. Or, if invention were in any way related to
            necessity, the poverty stricken fellahin of Egypt or Trans-Jordan or the equally
            hard-pressed coolies of China or the peasants of India would have devised some new and
            helpful methods for exploiting their available resources. This is far from being the
            case. Or, again, if biologically inherited talent had anything to do with inventiveness
            we would not have seen the great decrease in invention by the Chinese in the last
            thousand years, or the decrease in inventiveness among Anglo-Saxon Americans in the last
            hundred years, or the sudden appearance of inventiveness among noninventive peoples of
            eastern European stock when they migrated to America.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Inventiveness depends very largely on the way a society is organized.
            Some societies
            have powerful incentives to invent, because they are organized in such a way that
            innovation is encouraged and rewarded. This was true of Mesopotamian civilization before
            2700 B.C., of Chinese civilizations before A.D. 1200, and of Western civilization during
            much of its history. On the other hand, many societies are organized so that they have
            very weak incentives to invent. Suppose that a primitive tribe believes that its social
            organization was established by a deity who went away leaving strict instructions that
            nothing be changed. Such a society would invent very little. Egyptian civilization was
            something like this. Or any society that had ancestor worship would probably have weak
            incentives to invent. Or a society whose productive system was based on slavery would
            probably be uninventive, because the slaves, who knew the productive process most
            intimately, would have little incentive to devise new methods since these would be
            unlikely to benefit themselves, while the slaveowners would have only a distant
            acquaintance with the productive processes and would be reluctant to invent any new
            methods that might well require the ending of slavery for their successful exploitation.
            For these reasons, slave societies, such as Classical civilization or the Southern
            states of the United States in the period before 1860, have been notoriously
            uninventive. No major inventions in the field of production came from either of these
            cultures. The significance of this can be realized when we recall that at the very time
            that the South was inventing so little, the North, and especially the people of the
            Connecticut River Valley, were passing through one of the greatest periods of invention
            in history (cotton gin, mass production and interchangeable parts, steamboat, screw
            propeller, revolver, electric motor, vulcanizing rubber, sewing machine, anaesthesia,
            and so forth).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;\"Accumulation of surplus\" means that some persons or organizations
            in the society
            have
            more wealth passing through their control than they wish to use immediately or in the
            \"short run.\" This is so necessary to expansion that it means that some persons must
            have
            more than they need, even if others must have less than they need. If a society
            containing 100 persons is producing 100 square meals a day, it would, perhaps, be
            \"just\"
            for each person to obtain one meal a day, but such a distribution would never allow the
            society to increase its production of meals except by temporary and accidental increases
            called \"windfalls.\" If, however, the distribution of square meals in that society is
            organized so that fifty persons get only half a meal a day, twenty-five persons get one
            meal a day each, and twenty-five persons get two meals a day each, it might be possible
            for the society to increase its production of square meals. This could be done if
            someone invented a better way of producing square meals and if the twenty-five persons
            who get two meals each a day, consumed only one and a half meals each day and gave the
            surplus of twelve and a half meals each day to twenty-five of the fifty persons who had
            only half a meal each in return for their efforts in making the new, more productive,
            invention. This redistribution of meals to obtain the use of a new invention is what we
            mean by \"investment,\" the third essential element in any instrument of expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We thus have three possible ways in which the 100 meals produced by
            this society could
            be distributed. They could be written as follows:

            someone thinks of
            a new invention, since no one would have leisure to make it. With Type B distribution
            there may be an increase in output but only if someone thinks of a new invention and if
            the surplus of meals controlled by the twenty-five richest persons is redistributed to
            the poorer persons as payment for these poorer ones making the new invention. This would
            give a third type of income distribution if the surplus was invested in the way
            mentioned. Thus:

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Every kind of material progress and many kinds of nonmaterial progress
            depend upon the
            three factors we have mentioned. This is as true of parasitic societies as it is of
            productive societies. Let us imagine a solitary savage who lives by hunting and who, by
            throwing rocks at game from dawn to dusk, averages one rabbit a day. Let us further
            imagine that this diet of one rabbit a day is just enough to keep him alive until the
            next day. In such a situation this lonely hunter could not make a bow and arrow, even if
            he could invent it in his mind, because to make a bow and arrow would take, let us say,
            ten days\' work. Thus this savage has an incentive to invent, even has the necessary
            invention, but he has no surplus and cannot improve his position. Then let us assume
            that he throws a rock one day and kills a deer large enough to keep him alive for twelve
            days. He now has both invention (in his mind) and surplus (the deer). He may live from
            the deer for twelve days in idleness, or he may use his leisure from hunting to make the
            bow and arrow he has conceived. In the former case he will be no better off, and may be
            worse off because of loss of skill in rock throwing as a result of such leisure. In the
            latter case, on the contrary, his surplus (the deer) is transformed into a bow and arrow
            by investment, and at the end of ten days he has a new weapon that raises his ability to
            kill rabbits from an average of one a day to, say, an average of three a day. Of these
            three he can consume one a day himself, as previously, and support two other savages
            with the two other rabbits he kills each day. In return for such support, these two
            could be required to build a hut, to cure rabbit skins, to make additional arrows, and
            so forth. In this way the new capital equipment, the bow and arrow, has made it possible
            to raise the standards of living of all three.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is by some such process as this, but much more elaborate and
            complex, that
            civilizations grow, thrive, and expand. Every civilization must be organized in such a
            way that it has invention, capital accumulation, and investment. Loosely speaking, the
            term \"instrument of expansion\" might be applied to the organization for capital
            accumulation alone, although, strictly speaking, this organization should be called the
            surplus-creating instrument. This surplus-creating instrument is the essential element
            in any civilization, although, of course, there will be no expansion unless the two
            other elements (invention and investment) are also present. However, the
            surplus-creating instrument, by controlling the surplus and thus the disposition of it,
            will also control investment and will, thus, have at least an indirect influence on the
            incentive to invent. This surplus-creating instrument does not have to be an economic
            organization. In fact, it can be any kind of organization, military, political, social,
            religious, and so forth. In Mesopotamian civilization it was a religious organization,
            the Sumerian priesthood to which all members of the society paid tribute. In Egyptian,
            Andean and, probably, Minoan civilizations it was a political organization, a state that
            created surpluses by a process of taxation or tribute collection. In Classical
            civilization it was a kind of social organization, slavery, that allowed one class of
            society, the slaveowners, to claim most of the production of another class in society,
            the slaves. In the early part of Western civilization it was a military organization,
            feudalism, that allowed a small portion of the society, the fighting men or lords, to
            collect economic goods from the majority of society, the serfs, as a kind of payment for
            providing political protection for these serfs. In the later period of Western
            civilization the surplus-creating instrument was an economic organization (the
            price-profit system, or capitalism, if you wish) that permitted entrepreneurs who
            organized the factors of production to obtain from society in return for the goods
            produced by this organization a surplus (called profit) beyond what these factors of
            production had cost these entrepreneurs.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Like all instruments, an instrument of expansion in the course of time
            becomes an
            institution and the rate of expansion slows down. This process is the same as the
            institutionalization of any instrument, but appears specifically as a breakdown of one
            of the three necessary elements of expansion. The one that usually breaks down is the
            third— application of surplus to new ways of doing things. In modern terms we say that
            the rate of investment decreases. If this decrease is not made up by reform or
            circumvention, the two other elements (invention and accumulation of surplus) also begin
            to break down. This decrease in the rate of investment occurs for many reasons, of which
            the chief one is that the social group controlling the surplus ceases to apply it to new
            ways of doing things because they have a vested interest in the old ways of doing
            things. They have no desire to change a society in which they are the supreme group.
            Moreover, by a natural and unconscious self-indulgence, they begin to apply the surplus
            they control to non-productive but ego-satisfying purposes such as ostentatious display,
            competition for social honors or prestige, construction of elaborate residences,
            monuments, or other structures, and other expenditures which may distribute the
            surpluses to consumption but do not provide more effective methods of production.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When the instrument of expansion in a civilization becomes an
            institution, tension
            increases. In this case we call this \"tension of evolution.\" The society as a whole
            has
            become adapted to expansion; the mass of the population expect and desire it. A society
            that has an instrument of expansion expands for generations, even for centuries.
            People\'s minds become adjusted to expansion. If they are not \"better off\" each year
            than
            they were the previous year, or if they cannot give their children more than they
            themselves started with, they became disappointed, restless, and perhaps bitter. At the
            same time the society itself, after generations of expansion, is organized for expansion
            and undergoes acute stresses if expansion slows up.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The nature of these organizational stresses and tensions arising from
            a decrease in
            the rate of a society\'s expansion can be seen most clearly in contemporary Western
            civilization. In this society the economic system produces three kinds of goods: (a)
            consumers\' goods and services, (b) capital goods, which cannot be consumed but which
            can
            be used to make consumers\' goods, and (c) government goods and services, including
            armaments. In producing each kind of goods, the factors of production, such as land,
            labor, materials, capital, managerial skills, entrepreneurial enterprise, legal fees,
            distribution costs, and so forth, must be used and paid for. These costs, including
            profits for entrepreneurs, have a double aspect. On the one side they represent the
            costs of producing the goods, and thus determine the final selling price of the goods;
            this must be sufficiently high to cover these costs. But, on the other hand, these costs
            represent the incomes of those who receive them and thus represent the purchasing power
            available to buy the goods offered for sale. If we look, for a moment, only at the flow
            of consumers\' goods, we see that this flow of goods is offered for sale at a price
            that,
            by just covering the costs of the goods, is just equivalent to the purchasing power
            distributed to the economic community as incomes available for buying these goods. But,
            of course, some incomes are saved. These savings reduce the flow of purchasing power
            below the level of the flow of consumers\' goods at prices sufficient to cover costs of
            these goods. Thus there is not sufficient purchasing power available to buy the goods
            being offered at the price being asked, and either goods must go unsold or prices must
            fall, unless the money which was held back as savings appears in the market as
            purchasing power for consumers\' goods. Traditionally, this reappearance of savings as
            purchasing power in the market occurred through investment— that is, as expenditures for
            the factors of production to be used to make capital goods. This process provided the
            purchasing power needed to permit the flow of consumers\' goods to go to consumers
            because investment distributed rent, salaries, wages, interest, profits, and such to the
            community to form incomes and thus available purchasing power but did not demand
            purchasing power from the economic community because the producers\' goods created by
            these expenditures were not offered for sale to consumers, as consumers goods were, but,
            if sold at all, were merely exchanged for the savings of investors. This whole
            relationship means that our modern economic system cannot produce and consume what it
            produces unless it also invests (that is, expands).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;After centuries of expansion our society is now organized so that it
            cannot subsist;
            it must expand or it will collapse. This relationship might be expressed in the rule
            that, unless savings are invested in producers\' goods, there will not be sufficient
            purchasing power to buy the consumers\' goods that are being produced. Of course, as
            this
            problem has become increasingly acute in the contemporary period, a third factor has
            intervened: government spending. Such government spending provides purchasing power just
            as investment does. When the factors of production are mobilized at government cost to
            make a nuclear submarine, the community obtains incomes available as purchasing power,
            and no subsequent claim on this purchasing power is made by government action, since the
            submarine is not offered for sale. Of course, insofar as this government spending is
            covered by taxes levied on consumers\' purchasing power there is no net increase in such
            purchasing power; but a considerable part of government spending is covered by taxes on
            savings (and thus operates like investment) or is not covered by taxes at all (and thus
            represents a net increase in purchasing power, an inflationary increase when savings are
            being invested fully).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This rather complicated example of how an expanding society can become
            so organized
            for expansion that it enters upon an acute crisis if the expansion rate decreases is
            worth analyzing, because somewhat similar crises occur in all civilizations when the
            rate of expansion decreases. And such decrease is the chief result of the
            institutionalization of the instrument of expansion, something that occurs in every
            civilization. We shall see many examples of this and of the varied ways this process
            occurs when we make a more detailed analysis of the evolution of various civilizations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Our tentative definition of a civilization was \"a producing society
            that has writing
            and city life.\" This definition is imperfect because it is descriptive rather than
            analytical; it is also imperfect because it is not completely true. Western civilization
            about A.D. 970 had almost no city life, but still was a stage in a civilization. And
            Andean civilization, even under the Inca Empire, had no writing, but clearly was a
            civilization. It is now possible to offer a better, if not perfect, definition of a
            civilization: \"a producing society with an instrument of expansion.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Before we go on to examine the consequences when an instrument of
            expansion becomes an
            institution, we might point out that the surplus-creating organization that is such an
            essential part of any instrument of expansion does not need to be the only
            surplus-creating organization in the society. In all societies there are other, less
            significant, surplus- creating organizations than the one we have considered part of the
            instrument of expansion. In Mesopotamian civilization the significant surpluses were
            accumulated by the Sumerian priesthood from tithes and its own profits, but there can be
            no doubt that private persons were accumulating surpluses from profits of private
            enterprise or from the earnings of privately owned slaves or even from voluntary
            restrictions on their own consumption. These kinds of surplus accumulation may be found
            in any civilization no matter what preponderance may exist for its \"own\" instrument of
            expansion. In 1850, when Western civilization was most completely organized on the basis
            of private profit, surplus was undoubtedly being accumulated, and invested, from
            government taxes or from private slavery. And we would not be surprised if the most
            socialistic civilizations, like the Andean under the Incas or the Russian under the
            Soviets, had a certain amount of private accumulation from profits.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These variant and incidental types of surplus accumulation are usually
            of little
            significance in a civilization, not only for their relatively small volume of savings
            but even more because they are not usually expended in productive investment but rather
            are likely to end up in luxury expenditures and are, thus, little more than postponed or
            transferred consumption. In theory, however, it must be admitted that our statement that
            \"every civilization has an instrument of expansion\" could well be understood to mean
            that a civilization has at least one such instrument. Except for one dubious case, we do
            not know of any civilization, in its prime of life, that has had more than one
            significant surplus-creating organization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have said that an instrument of expansion, like all instruments,
            becomes an
            institution and that as a result the rate of expansion begins to decline. This
            institutionalization of the organization of expansion, which usually takes the form of a
            decreasing rate of investment (rather than of a decrease in either invention or in
            accumulation of surplus), leads to a crisis. This crisis, which we have called
            increasing tension of evolution, arises from the clash between the decreasing rate of
            expansion, on one hand, and the fact that people\'s minds and the organization of the
            society are arranged for expansion, on the other hand. Reserving until later our
            detailed examination of the forms this crisis takes, we might point out here that it
            usually gives rise to conflicts between the vested-interest groups that control the
            uninvested accumulations of surplus (because they control the surplus-creating
            organization in the society) and are sufficiently satisfied with the existing social
            organization to desire no change and the great mass of the population who are
            discontented at the dwindling prospects of expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The growing tension of evolution and the clashes it engenders can
            result in one of the
            three possible outcomes to the crisis. These are (1) reform, (2) circumvention, or (3)
            reaction. We speak of reform when the organization of expansion is rearranged so that it
            ceases to be an institution and becomes an instrument once more. We speak of
            circumvention when the vested-interest groups are left with much of their privileges
            intact and when a new instrument of expansion (especially a new surplus-accumulating
            instrument) grows up alongside the older institution and takes over the latter\'s
            expansive functions. We speak of reaction when the privileged vested-interest groups are
            able to prevent either reform or circumvention and, in consequence, the rate of
            expansion continues to decrease. If the outcome is reform or circumvention, the
            civilization once again has an instrument of expansion and the rate of expansion
            increases once again. If the outcome is reaction, the decline becomes chronic. There
            have been several cases where a civilization has succeeded in obtaining reform or
            circumvention of its institution of expansion, as we shall see in our detailed
            examination of the process of evolution in individual civilizations. The clearest case
            to be found is the evolution of our Western civilization, where both circumvention and
            reform have occurred. As a result Western civilization has had three periods of
            expansion, the first about 970-1270, the second about 1420-1650, and the third about
            1725-1929. The instrument of expansion in the first was feudalism, which became
            institutionalized into chivalry. This was circumvented by a new instrument of expansion
            that we might call commercial capitalism. When this organization became
            institutionalized into mercantilism, it was reformed into industrial capitalism, which
            became the instrument of expansion of the third age of expansion in the history of
            Western civilization. By 1930 this organization had become institutionalized into
            monopoly capitalism, and the society was, for the third time, in a major era of crisis.
            A detailed analysis of these changes will be provided later.

            a close examination of this process, it becomes possible to divide the history of any

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Every civilization, indeed every society, begins with a mixture of two
            or more
            cultures. Such mixture of cultures is very common; in fact, it occurs at the boundaries
            of all cultures to some extent. But such casual cultural mixture is of little
            significance unless there comes into existence in the zone of mixture a new culture,
            arising from the mixture but different from the constituent parts. The process is a
            little like the way in which a mixture of chemicals sometimes produces a new compound
            different from the mixing chemicals. In the case we are discussing, the new compound is
            a new society with a new culture. The contributing societies may be civilizations or
            merely producing societies (agricultural or pastoral) or merely parasitic societies
            (with hunting or fishing). Of the millions of cases of such cultural mixture that are
            occurring all the time, only rarely does there appear a new society. And even more
            rarely does this new society become organized in such a way that it is a producing
            society with an instrument of expansion. In the rare case where this occurs, we have the
            first stage of a new civilization. The fact that there have been no more than two dozen
            civilizations in almost ten thousand years of cultural mixture of producing societies
            will indicate how rare this occurrence is.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since cultural mixture occurs on the borders of societies,
            civilizations rarely
            succeed one another in the same geographic area, but undergo a displacement in space.
            The process may be described somewhat as follows. Within a society, people have little
            choice as to the ways in which they will satisfy basic needs (or fulfill their
            potentialities). If they are hungry, they eat the food their associates eat, prepared in
            the fashion customarily used in their society. If they wish companionship, or a picture
            of their relationship to the universe or a relationship to God or security or shelter or
            sex or children or whatever they may wish, they obtain these desires largely in the ways
            and forms provided by their own society. But on the borders of societies there is a
            considerable mutual interpenetration of social customs, and there arise, accordingly,
            alternative ways of satisfying human needs. This is, obviously, particularly true where
            intermarriage occurs, and where decisions must be taken and choices made as to which
            customs will be followed. Such choices are imperative in regard to bringing up the
            children of mixed marriages. When this occurs far enough inside the border of a society
            for there to be a social majority and consensus, there is no real choice, and, if any
            effort is made to make a choice, the children themselves will pre-empt for the local
            consensus. But in an area of fairly equal mixture, or in an area of unequal mixture
            where the majority culture is declining and decreasing in prestige, a very real need to
            make choices arises. These choices in themselves are not very significant in forming a
            new culture, but two other considerations are important. In the first place, the many
            choices being made must be morphologically compatible in order to give rise to the
            necessary amount of integration to permit a body of social custom to arise. And, in the
            second place, a certain number of families in the same locality must make the same or
            similar choices. In this way a new society may arise. If this society is productive and
            if it becomes organized so that it has an instrument of expansion, a new civilization
            will be born.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a consequence of these conditions, civilizations have generally
            arisen on the
            periphery of earlier civilizations. Canaanite, Hittite, and Minoan civilizations arose
            on the edges of Mesopotamian civilization. Classical civilization was born on the shores
            of the Aegean Sea, especially the eastern shore, on what was the periphery of Minoan
            civilization. Western civilization arose in western Europe, especially in France, which
            was a periphery of Classical civilization. And on other peripheries of Classical
            civilization were born Russian civilization and Islamic civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If the new society born from such mixture is a civilization, it has an
            instrument of
            expansion. This means that inventions begin to be made, surplus begins to be
            accumulated, and this surplus begins to be used to utilize new inventions. Eventually,
            as a result of these actions, expansion will begin. The interval before such expansion
            becomes evident, but after the most obvious mixture has ceased, may cover generations of
            time. This period will be called the Stage of Gestation. It is Stage 2 of any
            civilization. In general, it is a period in which the society seems to be changing very
            little, and most people seem to have fairly stable status situations in the social
            structure. But, under the surface, much of importance is taking place and, above all,
            the process of investment and invention that will make possible the following period of
            expansion is taking place.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Stage of Expansion is marked by four kinds of expansion: (a)
            increased production
            of goods, eventually reflected in rising standards of living; (b) increase in population
            of the society, generally because of a declining death rate; (c) an increase in the
            geographic extent of the civilization, for this is a period of exploration and
            colonization; and (d) an increase in knowledge. There are intimate interrelationships
            among these four. Increase in production is aided by expanding knowledge; the growth of
            population helps to increase production as well as to extend the geographic area of the
            society; the exploration and colonization associated with this extension of the
            society\'s geographic area is made possible by the growth of production and the growth
            of
            population, both of which permit people to be released for what are, at the beginning at
            least, nonproductive activities such as exploration; the same factors allow people to be
            released to seek knowledge of various kinds or to engage in nonmaterial activities such
            as artistic or philosophic activities, while the geographic expansion in itself leads to
            substantial increases in knowledge. This period of expansion is frequently a period of
            democracy, of scientific advance, and of revolutionary political change (as the various
            levels of society become adapted to an expanding mode of life from the more static mode
            of life prevalent in Stage 2). As a result of the geographic expansion of the society,
            it comes to be divided into two areas: the core area, which the civilization occupied at
            the end of Stage 2, and the peripheral area into which it expanded during Stage 3. The
            core area of Mesopotamian civilization was the lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates
            rivers; the peripheral area was the highlands surrounding this valley and more remote
            areas like Iran, Syria, and Anatolia. The core area of Minoan civilization was the
            island of Crete; its peripheral area included the Aegean Islands and the Balkan coast.
            The core area of Classical civilization was the shores of the Aegean Sea; its peripheral
            areas were the whole Mediterranean seacoast and ultimately Spain, North Africa, and
            Gaul. The core area of Western civilization covered northern Italy, most of France, the
            Low Countries, England, and extreme western Germany; its peripheral areas included the
            rest of Europe to eastern Poland, North and South America, and Australia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When expansion begins to slow up in the core areas, as a result of the
            instrument of
            expansion becoming institutionalized, and the core area becomes increasingly static and
            legalistic, the peripheral areas continue to expand (by what is essentially a process of
            geographic circumvention) and frequently shortcut many of the developments experienced
            by the core area. As a result, by the latter half of Stage 3, the peripheral areas are
            tending to become wealthier and more powerful than the core areas. Another way of saying
            this is that the core area tends to pass from Stage 3 to Stage 4 earlier than do the
            peripheral areas. In time the instrument of expansion becomes an institution throughout
            the society, investment begins to decrease, and the rate of expansion (although not
            expansion itself) begins to decline.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As soon as the rate of expansion in a civilization begins to decline
            noticeably, it
            enters Stage 4, the Age of Conflict. This is probably the most complex, most
            interesting, and most critical of all the seven stages. It is marked by four chief
            characteristics: (a) it is a period of declining rate of expansion; (b) it is a period
            of growing tension of evolution and increasing class conflicts, especially in the core
            area; (c) it is a period of increasingly frequent and increasingly violent imperialist
            wars; and (d) it is a period of growing irrationality, pessimism, superstitions, and
            otherworldliness. The declining rate of expansion is caused by the institutionalization
            of the instrument of expansion. The growing class conflicts arise from the increasing
            tension of evolution, from the obvious conflict of interests between a society adapted
            to expansion and the vested interests controlling the uninvested surpluses of the
            institution of expansion who fear social change more than anything else. Usually there
            is a majority of the frustrated struggling against the minority of vested interests,
            although usually neither side has any clear idea of the real issues at stake or what
            would give a workable solution to the crisis. All programs for sharing the surplus of
            the few among the discontented many are worse than useless, since expansion can be
            resumed only if the three necessary elements of an instrument of expansion are provided,
            and the dissipation of surpluses among a large mass of consumers will not provide any
            one of these three necessary elements. On the contrary most revolutionary programs,
            aroused by the failure of the third element (investment), will merely make the crisis
            more acute by destroying the second element (accumulation of surplus). The only sensible
            or workable solution to the crisis of the civilization would be to reform or circumvent
            the old institution of expansion by establishing again the three basic elements of any
            instrument of expansion. Since the disgruntled masses know nothing about such things,
            and since the vested interests do not know much more and are usually concentrating their
            energies on an effort to defend their vested interests, a new instrument of expansion,
            if it appears, usually does so by accident and through the path of circumvention rather
            than by reform. If a new instrument of expansion does come into existence, the
            civilization begins to expand again, the tension of evolution and the crisis subside,
            and the civilization is once again in Stage 3.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Age of Conflict (Stage 4) is a period of imperialist wars and of
            irrationality
            supported for reasons that are usually different in the different social classes. The
            masses of the people (who have no vested interest in the existing institution of
            expansion) engage in imperialist wars because it seems the only way to overcome the
            slowing down of expansion. Unable to get ahead by other means (such as economic means),
            they seek to get ahead by political action, above all by taking wealth from their
            political neighbors. At the same time they turn to irrationality to compensate for the
            growing insecurity of life, for the chronic economic depression, for the growing
            bitterness and dangers of class struggles, for the growing social disruption and
            insecurity from imperialist wars. This is generally a period of gambling, use of
            narcotics or intoxicants, obsession with sex (frequently as perversion), increasing
            crime, growing numbers of neurotics and psychotics, growing obsession with death and
            with the Hereafter.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The vested interests encourage the growth of imperialist wars and
            irrationality
            because both serve to divert the discontent of the masses away from their vested
            interests (the uninvested surplus). Accordingly, some of the defenders of vested
            interests divert a certain part of their surplus to create instruments of class
            oppression, instruments of imperialist wars, and instruments of irrationality. Once
            these instruments are created and begin to become institutions of class oppression, of
            imperialist wars, and of irrationality, the chances of the institution of expansion
            being reformed into an instrument of expansion become almost nil. These three new vested
            interests in combination with the older vested institution of expansion are in a
            position to prevent all reform. The last of these three, the old institution of
            expansion, now begins to lose its privileges and advantages to the three institutions it
            has financed. Of these three, the institution of class oppression controls much of the
            political power of the society; the institution of imperialist wars controls much of the
            military power of the society; and the institution of irrationality controls much of the
            intellectual life of the society. These three (which may be combined into only two or
            one) become dominant, and the group that formerly controlled the institution of
            expansion falls back into a secondary role, its surpluses largely absorbed by its own
            creations. In this way, in Mesopotamian civilization, the Sumerian priesthood, which had
            been the original instrument of expansion, fell into a secondary role behind the secular
            kings it had set up to command its armies in the imperialist wars of its Age of
            Conflict. In the same way in Classical civilization the slaveowning landlords who had
            been the original instrument of expansion were largely eclipsed by the mercenary army
            that had been created to carry on the imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict but took
            on life and purposes of its own and came to dominate Classical civilization completely.
            So too the Nazi party, which had been financed by some of the German monopoly
            capitalists as an instrument of class oppression, of imperialist war, and of
            irrationality, took on purposes of its own and began to dominate the monopoly
            capitalists for its own ends.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a result of the imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict, the number
            of political
            units in the civilization is reduced. Eventually one unit emerges triumphant. When this
            occurs we are in Stage 5, the Stage of Universal Empire. Just as the core area passes
            from Stage 3 to Stage 4 earlier than the peripheral area does, so the core area comes to
            be conquered by a single state before the whole civilization is conquered by the
            universal empire. In Mesopotamia the core area was conquered by Babylonia as early as
            1700 B.C., but the whole civilization was not conquered by a universal empire until
            Assyria about 725 B.C. (replaced by Persia about 525 B.C.). In Classical civilization
            the core area was conquered by Macedonia about 330 B.C.; the whole civilization was
            conquered by Rome about 146 B.C. Western civilization has gone from Stage 3 to Stage 4
            three different times. The three Ages of Conflict are: (a) the period of the Hundred
            Years\' War, say 1300-1430; (b) the period of the Second Hundred Years\' War, say
            1650-1815; and (c) the period of war crisis that began about 1900 and still continues.
            In each case the core was conquered by an imperialist state: by England under Henry V
            about 1420, by France under Napoleon about 1810, and by Germany under Hitler about 1942.
            In the first two cases the old institution of expansion (chivalry and mercantilism) was
            circumvented by a new instrument of expansion (commercial capitalism and industrial
            capitalism), and a new period of expansion commenced. In the third case it is too early
            to see what has happened. We may be getting a new instrument of expansion that will
            circumvent monopoly capitalism and bring our civilization once again into a period of
            expansion. Or we may continue in the Age of Conflict until the whole of our civilization
            comes to be dominated by a single state (probably the United States).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the imperialist wars of Stage 4 of a civilization the more
            peripheral states are
            consistently victorious over less peripheral states. In Mesopotamian civilization the
            core states like Uruk, Kish, Ur, Nippur, and Lagash were conquered by more peripheral
            states like Agade and Babylon. These in turn were conquered by peripheral Assyria, and
            the whole of western Asia was ultimately conquered by fully peripheral Persia. In Minoan
            civilization the core area of Crete itself seems to have been conquered by peripheral
            Mycenae. In Classical civilization the core area Ionian states led by Athens were
            conquered by the semiperipheral Dorian states Sparta and Thebes, and the whole
            Greek-speaking world was then conquered by more peripheral Macedonia. Ultimately the
            whole of Classical civilization was conquered by fully peripheral Rome. In the New World
            the two isolated maize civilizations seem to provide a similar pattern. In Mesoamerica
            the core Mayan cities of Yucatan and Guatemala seem to have been overcome by the
            semiperipheral Toltecs and these, in turn, by the fully peripheral Aztecs of highland
            Mexico. In the Andes region the core area seems to have been along the coast and in the
            northern highlands of Peru. These cultures were submerged by a number of more peripheral
            cultures of which the most successful was the Tiahuanaco from the southern highlands of
            Peru. And finally, at a late date, not a century before Pizarro, the whole Andean
            civilization was conquered by the fully peripheral Incas from the forbidding central
            highlands.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the Far East and Middle East the same sequence can be discerned.
            The core area of
            Sinic civilization was in the Huang Ho Valley. This area was conquered by Chou about
            1000 B.C. and by semiperipheral Ch\'in from the mountains of Shensi eight centuries
            later
            (221 B.C.). The whole of Sinic society was then brought into a single universal empire
            by the Han dynasty from its southern periphery (202 B.C.— A.D. 220). The Sinic
            civilization was destroyed by Hunnish nomad invaders before A.D. 400, and a new
            civilization, which we call Chinese, began to rise from the wreckage along its southern
            frontier. The core of this society seems to have been south of the Yangtze River. This
            core came under a single political rule as early as 700 under the T\'ang dynasty. Wider
            areas were added by successive dynasties of which the Yuan or Mongols were so remote
            that they can be regarded neither as peripheral nor even as Chinese (1260- 1368); the
            Ming (1368-1644) were of southern Chinese (and thus peripheral) origin; and the final
            universal empire of the Manchu (1644-1912) was from the peripheral north, Manchuria,
            with its original seat of power at Mukden.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The history of the Middle East provides similar evidence. We cannot
            speak with any
            assurance about the Indic civilization, but it seems likely that its earliest origins
            were in the lower valley (Sind) and are to be seen in the excavations at Chandu-Daro,
            while later it moved northward into the Punjab (upper valley) and found its universal
            empire in the originally peripheral Harappa area. After the destruction of this culture
            by the Aryan invaders from the northwest, the successor Hindu civilization began to
            arise (late second millennium B.C.) in the Ganges Valley. The core area of this new
            civilization fell under the political control of the local Maurya (ca. 540-184 B.C.) and
            Gupta (ca. 320-535) dynasties. Then, as Hindu culture spread over the whole Indian
            subcontinent, political dominance shifted to peripheral powers such as the
            Gurjara-Prathihara dynasty (ca. 740-1036), originating from Central Asiatic pastoral
            invaders, and a series of Moslem dynasties, mostly Turkish, at Delhi (after 1266),
            culminating in the universal empire of the Moguls (1526-1857).

            The core area of
            this civilization is to be found in western Arabia. As its culture spread over most of
            western Asia and northern Africa, political domination fell to increasingly peripheral
            dynasties: the Ommiad Caliphate, of Arabic origin, ruled from Damascus during much of
            its period (661-750), while its successor, the Abbaside Caliphate, ruled from Bagdad
            (750-ca. 930). The Seljuk Turks ruled briefly (1050-1110) from Persia and were
            ultimately succeeded by the universal empire of the Ottoman Turks with its center in
            Anatolia (1300-1922).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The victory of more peripheral states over less peripheral states
            during Stage 4 of
            any civilization seems so well established that it is worthwhile to seek the reasons for
            it. A number of these can be mentioned. In the first place, as a general rule, material
            culture diffuses more easily than nonmaterial culture, so that peripheral areas tend to
            become more materialistic than less peripheral areas; while the latter spend much of
            their time, wealth, energy, and attention on religion, philosophy, art, or literature,
            the former spend a much greater proportion of these resources on military, political,
            and economic matters. Therefore, peripheral areas are more likely to win victories. This
            contrast is quite clear between, let us say, Sumerians and Assyrians, between Ionians
            and Dorians, between Greeks and Latins, between Mayas and Aztecs, or even between
            Europeans and Americans.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A second reason for the victories of more peripheral states arises
            from the fact that
            the process of evolution is slightly earlier in more central areas than in peripheral
            ones. Thus the central areas have already passed on to Stage 4 and may even have
            achieved a premature dress rehearsal of Stage 5 (with the achievement of a single core
            empire) while peripheral areas are still in a relatively vigorous Stage 3. Generally
            speaking, military victory is more likely to go to an area or state in Stage 3 than to
            one in any later stage, because the later stages (and the more central areas) are more
            harassed by class conflicts and are more paralyzed by the inertia and obstruction of
            institutions. Core areas generally have been ravaged for a longer period of imperialist
            wars. The combination of these obstacles gives the inhabitants of a core area a kind of
            world-weariness (sometimes called a \"failure of nerve\") that is in sharp contrast to
            their own earlier attitudes or to those of their more peripheral rivals. Accordingly,
            the task of creating a universal empire is likely to be left to such rivals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It should be noted that in some cases, such as Egypt, Crete, or
            Russia, a single
            political unit has ruled over the civilization from its early history. This generally
            arises in civilizations whose instrument of expansion is a socialist state. In such a
            case imperialist wars are not so prevalent a characteristic of Stage 4, and the
            achievement of a single political unit (universal empire) is not one of the chief
            characteristics of that stage. As a result the stage may last a shorter time and cannot
            be so easily demarcated from earlier and later stages as can be done in civilizations
            where imperialist war and achievement of a universal empire are two of the most
            prominent marks of the stage. Absence of these items does not indicate absence of the
            stage, which is marked by its other, less easily observed, characteristics, such as
            decreasing rate of expansion, growing class conflicts, declining democracy, dying
            science, decreasing inventiveness, and growing irrationality.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When a universal empire is established in a civilization, the society
            enters upon a
            \"golden age.\" At least this is what it seems to the periods that follow it. Such a
            golden age is a period of peace and of relative prosperity. Peace arises from the
            absence of any competing political units within the area of the civilization itself, and
            from the remoteness or even absence of struggles with other societies outside.
            Prosperity arises from the ending of internal belligerent destruction, the reduction of
            internal trade barriers, the establishment of a common system of weights, measures, and
            coinage, and from the extensive government spending associated with the establishment of
            a universal empire. But this appearance of prosperity is deceptive. Little real economic
            expansion is possible because no real instrument of expansion exists. New inventions are
            rare, and real economic investment is lacking. The vested interests have triumphed and
            are living off their capital, building unproductive and blatant monuments like the
            Pyramids, the \"Hanging Gardens of Babylon,\" the Colosseum, or (as premature examples)
            Hitler\'s Chancellery and the Victor Emmanuel Memorial. The masses of the people in such
            an empire live from the waste of these non-productive expenditures. The golden age is
            really the glow of overripeness, and soon decline begins. When it becomes evident, we
            pass from Stage 5 (Universal Empire) to Stage 6 (Decay).

            political levels of the society begin to lose the allegiance of the masses of the people

            period of decay may last for a long time, but eventually the civilization can no longer

            same time, as Crete could not after 1400 B.C., as Rome could not after A.D. 350, as the
            Incas and Aztecs could not after 1500, as India could not after 1700, as China could not
            after 1830, and as Islam could not after 1850.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Stage 7 is the Stage of Invasion, when the civilization, no longer

            Frequently these outsiders are another, younger, and more powerful civilization. The

            several of the invasions listed above. The invasions of the Greek tribes, which ended

            Germanic tribes, which ended Classical civilization, marked Stage 1 of Western
            civilization.

    <array name="content_5_5_7">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The seven stages are merely a convenient way of dividing a complex
            historical process.
            This process is not relentlessly deterministic at all points but merely at some points,
            in the sense that men have power and free will but their actions have consequences
            nevertheless. In general, if cultural mixture produces a new producing society with an
            instrument of expansion we have Stage 1 of a civilization. Stages 2, 3, and 4 will
            follow inevitably. This means that, if a producing society has an instrument of
            expansion, saving and investment will lead to expansion, and this expansion will
            eventually slow up as the instrument becomes an institution. At this point, in the early
            part of Stage 4 there is considerable freedom since the institutionalized instrument of
            expansion may be reformed or circumvented. If it is, expansion will be resumed, and the
            civilization will again be in Stage 3. If it is not reformed or circumvented, reaction
            will triumph, and the crisis will become worse. The choice between reform and reaction
            is not, however, a rigid one. The last part of Stage 3 may be a continual series of
            minor reforms and circumventions to the point where the creation of new instruments just
            about balances the institutionalization of old instruments and expansion continues at a
            fair rate for a considerable time. Circumvention,, especially geographic circumvention,
            may force institutions that would not otherwise have reformed to do so in order to
            compete. Thus, for example, as the textile industry of New England became
            institutionalized, new, more modern plants grew up in the South; the existence of these
            southern plants (a case of geographic circumvention) forced the textile mills of New
            England either to modernize or to perish. On a more dramatic scale the whole industrial
            system of England, in recent times, has been in an institutionalized condition and has
            been faced with the choice of reforming, thus creating new economic activities and new
            economic organizations, or perishing from the competition of peripheral areas, like the
            United States, or semiperipheral areas, like Germany (or even other civilizations, like
            Japan or India).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because of such conditions as these, the whole first part of the Age
            of Conflict
            (Stage 4) is a period of crisis and of hope. Only when the vested interests create new
            instruments of class oppression, of imperialist wars, and of irrationality, and when
            these new instruments, in turn, begin to become institutions, does hope fade. Crisis
            becomes endemic in the civilization, and continues until the universal empire with its
            golden age is established. In those civilizations that had a single political unit from
            an earlier stage, like Egyptian, Minoan, or Orthodox civilization, the Age of Conflict
            is frequently of briefer duration because imperialist wars are of limited extent. The
            fact that these one-state civilizations frequently have a socialist state as their
            instrument of expansion also serves to obscure the duration of the Age of Conflict
            because such a civilization has weak incentives to invent in its Age of Expansion and
            less dramatic class conflicts in its Age of Conflict, thus serving to obscure the
            transition from one of these stages to the other.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In theory there is nothing rigid about Stage 5. So far as observations
            of past
            civilizations indicate, every civilization passes from the Age of Conflict to the Age of
            Universal Empire. That means that one state, probably a peripheral one, emerges
            triumphant over the whole area of the civilization. But in theory it is at least
            conceivable that the competing states of Stage 4 might just fight each other down and
            down to lower and lower levels of prosperity and public order without one emerging
            triumphant over all the others. In such a case, Stage 5 might be omitted, and the
            civilization would pass directly from Stage 4 to Stage 6 (Conflict to Decay) without
            achieving any universal empire. Something like this may have been true of Mesoamerican
            civilization. In a similar way, it is conceivable, in theory, that a civilization could
            continue for a very long time in the Stage of Decay without passing on to Stage 7. For
            there can be no invasion to end the civilization unless there are invaders to come in.
            Egypt, for example, was so well protected by seas and deserts against invaders that its
            Stage of Decay lasted for more than a thousand years. It is also, in theory, conceivable
            that some universal empire some day might cover the whole globe, leaving no external
            \"barbarians\" to serve as invaders.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This point leads to one final consideration, namely, the relationship
            of outside
            societies to any civilization. In theory again, it would seem that an outside society
            that was stronger than a given civilization might at any time come in and smash it. In
            practice, however, it seems that civilizations are in little danger of such an
            experience except early or late in their careers. In general, a civilization is in no
            danger from any society except another civilization from Stage 2 to Stage 6. In Stage 6,
            however, it is in danger from any society, even a parasitic one, as is clear from the
            destruction of Cretan, Classical, Hittite, and Sinic civilizations by noncivilized
            invaders. When two civilizations collide we may use the tentative rule that the victory
            will go to the one that is closer to Stage 3 (Expansion) but that neither one will be
            destroyed unless it is in Stage 6. In 492-479 B.C. Classical civilization, in Stage 3,
            and Mesopotamian civilization, in the last part of Stage 5, collided, and the former
            won; in 336-323 they collided again, with Classical in Stage 4 and Mesopotamian in Stage
            6, and the latter was destroyed. In 264-146 B.C. Classical civilization in Stage 4 met
            Canaanite civilization in Stage 6, and destroyed it. In 711-814 Western civilization in
            Stage 2 was able to preserve itself against Islamic civilization in Stage 3; three
            hundred years later, in what we call the Crusades, Western civilization in Stage 3
            returned the visit to Islamic civilization, then in Stage 4, but could not destroy it.
            However, in 1850-1920, Western civilization, just reaching the end of Stage 3, again
            collided with Islamic civilization, now in Stage 6, and destroyed its universal empire,
            the Ottoman Empire, and probably liquidated the whole civilization, a process that is
            still going on. This was only one of several civilizations that were in a similar stage
            and that have met, or appear to be now meeting, a similar fate. The other universal
            empires in Stage 6 that have been destroyed by Western civilization while in Stage 3 are
            the Inca, the Aztec, the Manchu, the Mogul (in India), and perhaps the Tokugawa (in
            Japan). At the present time India seems to be in Stage 2 of a new civilization; China
            may be in Stage 1 of a new civilization; while the situation in Japan and in the Near
            East is still too chaotic to make any judgments about what is happening. Russian
            civilization, which began about A.D. 500 and had its period of expansion about
            1500-1900, had the state as its instrument of expansion and was just entering upon Stage
            4 in 1917 when the reform of this institution gave it a new instrument of expansion. As
            a result, Russian civilization has been in Stage 3 for the second time in recent years,
            but it remains a relatively weak civilization because of its weak incentives to
            invention. A collision between this civilization, which is early in Stage 3, and Western
            civilization, which has just begun Stage 4, would probably be indecisive in its outcome.
            If Western civilization reforms and again passes into Stage 3, it will be far too
            powerful to be defeated by Russian civilization; if Western civilization does not
            reform, but continues through the Stage of Conflict into the Stage of Universal Empire,
            the threat from Russian civilization will be much greater. However, by that time the new
            Indian civilization or the new Chinese civilization may be in Stage 3 and will present
            greater threats to both Western and Russian civilizations than either of these will
            present to the other. The possible, but by no means inevitable, relationships of these
            four civilizations in terms of the relevant stages can be seen from the following chart.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already said that civilizations are like crystals, which are
            frequently
            distorted by efforts to share the same crystalline material. They are also distorted by
            the noncrystalline material or \"matrix\" in which they are embedded. The matrix source
            from which diamonds are derived is great cylindrical pipes of friable blue clay that
            rises vertically from the remote depths of the earth to just below the surface. In this
            clay the diamonds are found embedded like currants in a fruitcake. Of course the
            diamonds in a \"pipe\" of blue clay are much less frequent than the currants in any
            acceptable piece of cake. In this they are like civilizations, which are very infrequent
            occurrences in a matrix of time, space, and noncivilized cultures.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The matrix in which civilizations occur is five-dimensional just as
            culture is. These
            include the same three dimensions of space, the fourth dimension of time, and the fifth
            dimension of abstraction. Before we make any serious attempt to apply the seven stages
            of civilization, we should have a somewhat clearer idea of this matrix in order to
            understand the distorting influences it may exercise on the seven stages of normal
            evolution in a civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The three dimensions of space in which a civilization is found include
            its geographic
            environment. Since we are primarily interested in our own Western civilization and its
            direct predecessors rather than in the New World or the Far Eastern civilizations, we
            shall speak here only of the geographic matrix in which Western civilization arose. This
            area, including Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, was aptly called the
            \"Northwest Quadrant\" by the historian James Henry Breasted. Bounded on the south by
            the
            Sahara Desert along the line of latitude 20°N. and on the east by the northeast-running
            line of the Pamir, Tien Shan, and Altai Mountains, its western and northern frontiers
            are formed by the great arc of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Within this great quadrant the land mass of Afro-Eurasia has the form
            of a letter \"L\"
            which has been rotated in a clockwise direction a quarter turn. The apex of this figure
            lies in the northwest, in Europe, while one limb runs eastward into Asia and the other
            limb runs southward into Africa. Europe\'s position at the apex of these two lines has
            made it a mixing area, with the African influences more important in the prehistoric
            period and the Asiatic influences more important in the historic period. This mixing
            role of Europe has been modified also by the extreme diversity of Europe\'s terrain,
            which has given it a very convoluted coast line, creating numerous inland seas and semi
            isolated valleys that give onto the sea. The result of these two geographic influences
            has been to give Europe great diversity of both geographic conditions and cultural
            influences in a small area.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Northwest Quadrant falls into three zones, flatlands in the north
            and south being
            separated by the east-west spine of the Highland Zone. The Highland Zone is a broken
            sequence of mountains and plateaus from the Pyrenees through the Alps, Apennines, Balkan
            highlands, Carpathian Mountains, Anatolian Plateau, Caucasus, and Iranian Plateau to the
            Himalayas and the line of highlands that form the eastern boundary of the Northwest
            Quadrant. North of this Highland Zone lie the Northern Flatlands, which begin as a
            narrow wedge in the Netherlands and run eastward across the Northwest Quadrant, widening
            steadily as they move eastward so that they are only a couple of hundred miles wide in
            western Europe but broaden to almost two thousand miles wide in Asia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Southern Flatlands are opposite in pattern to the Northern
            Flatlands since they
            are broadest in the extreme west and are narrower in northeastern Africa and Arabia,
            finally falling below sea level in the extreme east to form the bottoms of the Arabian
            Sea and Indian Ocean.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This simple, and oversimplified, three-zone pattern of the Northwest
            Quadrant is
            complicated by a number of other features of which the most obvious are the inland seas,
            rivers, and mountain passes. One of the chief of these features is the Mediterranean
            Sea, which runs east and west just south of the Highland Zone. The geographic
            significance of the Mediterranean Sea, of course, is that it divides Europe from Africa,
            but its cultural significance is distinctly different because it has served to link its
            shores together rather than to divide them. This binding influence of the Mediterranean
            in the cultural sphere lasted for over 4,000 years, from the first establishment of
            distant maritime travel about 3500 B.C. to the Arab conquest of North Africa and the
            Near East about A.D. 700. During this period the techniques of water transportation were
            far more efficient and cheaper than the techniques of land travel. This superiority of
            movement by water continued for more than a thousand years after the Arab conquest, the
            technological lag of land travel beginning to close only with the invention of the
            macadam road, the coach, and the railroad after 1750. In the thousand or more years
            after 700, the linking influence of superior maritime communication in the Mediterranean
            was counterweighed by the cultural division between Moslem culture on its southern and
            eastern shores and Christian culture on its northern and western shores; but in the four
            thousand years before the Arabic conquest the technological factor was not counteracted
            by any profound cultural differences, and the shores tended to be drawn together by
            marine communication into a single cultural system. At that time the cultural division
            was not along the Mediterranean Sea but on the mountain barrier running parallel to it
            to the north. Classical civilization, especially as it grew into the Roman Empire, was
            the culmination of these influences. They were reflected in the term \"Our Sea\" (Mare
            nostrum), applied by the Romans to the Mediterranean, while the peoples north of the
            mountains (who were biologically closer relatives but culturally remote) were called
            \"barbarians\" for most of the Classical period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Less obvious than the Mediterranean were other geographical features
            of the Northwest
            Quadrant, especially those serving as interregional connections. Of these links two of
            the more significant were the \"Syrian Saddle\" and the \"Vardar-Morava route.\" The
            Syrian
            Saddle is the low pass across the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountains around the northern
            edge of the Syrian Desert just at the point where the Euphrates River approaches closest
            to the Mediterranean Sea. The mountains and deserts surrounding this \"saddle\" make it
            the only feasible route connecting the Aegean, the Mediterranean, and Egypt to the west
            with Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf to the east. In a similar fashion the
            Vardar-Morava river valleys provide a route that joins the Aegean Sea near Salonika with
            the middle Danube. The importance of these two links can be seen in the fact that such
            significant innovations as metallurgy, alphabetic writing, and Christianity came to
            Europe by way of the Syrian Saddle and the Mediterranean, while the knowledge of
            agriculture first came to Europe north of the mountains by way of the Vardar-Morava
            valley.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already said that the first civilization began in Mesopotamia
            before 5000 B.C.
            when people of the Neolithic Garden cultures moved from the Highland Zone down into the
            alluvial valley and were able to create permanent settlements because of the
            refertilizing function of the annual floods. These people are known as Sumerians. They
            were distinguished by two significant features. Physically they were a rather stocky,
            roundheaded people who seem to have worn closely clipped hair and no beards. And
            linguistically they spoke an agglutinative language related to Elamite, Hurrian, and
            other Highland Zone languages but not related either to the inflected Indo-European
            languages then forming on the Northern Flatlands or to the inflected Semite languages
            already formed on the Southern Flatlands (Arabia). This difference in language between
            the Highland Zone peoples and their neighbors in the Flatlands to the north and the
            south (at least in western Asia) was also reflected in a difference of physical type.
            The peoples of both Flatlands tended to be longheaded, wore long hair and beards, and
            were less stocky in bone structure. The peoples of the Southern Flatlands (the Semite
            speakers) were less tall, and darker in eye, hair color, and complexion than the peoples
            of the Northern Flatlands (the proto-Indo-European speakers).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This sandwichlike arrangement of peoples on the triplezoned terrain of
            western Asia
            seems to have existed when Mesopotamian civilization was first beginning in the
            centuries before 5000 B.C. and was still in existence two thousand years later (say 3300
            B.C.) when the invention of writing and of bronze making marked the shift, at almost the
            same time, from the prehistoric to the historic period and from the Chalcolithic (or
            Copper-Stone Age) to the Bronze Age. In fact, the sandwichlike appearance of western
            Asia was, if anything, increased by 3300 B.C., because by that later date the Highland
            Zone peoples remained agriculturalists in the double sense we have indicated, while both
            the Semites to the south and the proto-Indo-Europeans to the north had adopted the care
            of domestic animals (but not the planting of crops) and had become pastoral peoples.
            There were other, less dramatic, evidences of this sandwich arrangement. For example,
            both Flatland dwellers tended to be warlike and patriarchal, and, in religion,
            emphasized the power of masculine sky gods, while the Highland dwellers tended to be
            more peaceful, more matriarchal, and had as their chief deity a goddess of fertility and
            sex who resided in the earth.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This triple pattern of language, physical type, and social customs
            must not, of
            course, be made too rigid. A certain amount of mixture and confusion of the pattern must
            have existed at all times. But there can be no doubt that some such pattern as this did
            exist on the three-zoned terrain of western Asia along the line of longitude 45° East at

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;One of the principal tasks of Old World history is to find some
            explanation of this
            sandwich pattern of human society at the dawn of history. This can be done to some
            extent by the triple pattern of geographic terrain, but, while such explanation may be
            helpful in respect to social customs, it is not completely satisfactory there, and is
            completely inadequate in explaining the distribution of languages or of physical types
            of men. Accordingly, explanation based on geographic factors must be supplemented by
            inferences regarding the events of the prehistoric period before 3000 B.C. In making
            such inferences we have the evidence supplied by archaeology, but this in turn must be
            interpreted in terms of the sandwich pattern to be found in the later, historic period.
            Unfortunately, the areal and chronological specialization of most archaeologists and
            ancient historians has hampered them in making such inferences or even in realizing the
            need for them.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Before we present our own inferences on this matter, we should be
            quite clear what it
            is that we are seeking to do. We are trying to explain the distribution of languages,
            physical types, and social customs of western Asia as the matrix in which the earliest,
            and later, civilizations of that area appeared. Specifically, we wish to explain the
            pattern of these along the line of 45° East longitude just before 3000 B.C. This pattern
            can be summed up in the table on the next slide.
        </item>
        <item>Imageimage_6_16</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Some of this pattern can be explained in terms of fairly obvious
            geographic and social
            factors. The archaeological record shows that the earliest agriculturalists were
            Highland Zone peoples who had both domestic animals (goats, sheep, and cattle) and crop
            planting, at a time when the dwellers in both Flatlands were still hunters. The earliest
            peasants were peaceful because there was a supply of adequately watered land available
            for occupation by the limited numbers of peasants, without any need to fight for it.
            Moreover these earliest gardeners engaged in hoe culture (without plows), which was
            originally a female activity at a time when males continued to hunt. Later, as the
            development of sedentary life made hunting dwindle in significance, men became animal
            tenders, but the food for both the men and their animals was a female product.
            Furthermore, the shift from hunting to agriculture provided a rising and more secure
            standard of living that made possible, as well as desirable, an increase in population.
            This was also produced by females. The upshot of all this was that the two chief desires
            of men, that the earth should produce crops and that women should produce offspring,
            became intellectually confused into a single mystery best summed up in the word
            \"fertility.\" The reverence and desire for fertility led to a higher social and
            economic
            status for women and to the growth of new religious ideas quite different from the
            animistic religious conceptions of earlier hunting peoples. These new ideas are usually
            associated with a belief in an earth mother goddess whose confused powers of sexual and
            agrarian fertility were revered for thousands of years afterward.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Neolithic Garden cultures were well adapted to the adequately
            watered hills,
            parklands, and valleys of the Highland Zone and, with certain modifications, were able
            to move into alluvial river valleys and across the loess and other semiopen areas of
            Europe and Asia, but they were not able to penetrate the grassy flatlands, both North
            and South. In many places these flatlands were too arid for neolithic cultures; in more
            humid regions the grassy sod was too thick to yield to hoe culture; but, above all, most
            grassland were inhabited by savage, warlike, hunting peoples struggling for the right to
            live from the grass-eating herds of the flatlands. In the north these herds were mostly
            horses and cattle; in the south they were mostly antelope, camels, and asses. In both
            cases crop planting and the peasant way of life were excluded.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;But the domestication of animals and, later, the use of metals were
            not excluded. In
            the period before 3000 B.C., both of these diffused from the Highland Zone to the
            flatlands of Arabia and of the trans-Caspian steppes. Thus, at the dawn of history the
            peoples of those areas had made the shift from Stone Age hunting peoples to Bronze Age
            pastoral peoples, while retaining and even intensifying their warlike, patriarchal
            social system. And, naturally, their linguistic and physical characteristics remained as
            before.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In order to explain these linguistic and physical characteristics of
            the three-zoned
            sandwich of western Asia, we must go much more deeply into the prehistory of the peoples
            involved. This will require some speculations about the origins of these peoples before
            they arrived in their respective areas of western Asia. In order to handle these
            problems, we must have a chronological system that will permit us to organize the
            population movements that brought these peoples to the places they occupied at the dawn
            of history. Such a chronology can be established in terms of climate changes.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Once again we must begin with the better-known present and work
            backward into the
            less-known past. On the oversimplified picture of the Northwest Quadrant as a threezoned
            geographic pattern, we should like to superimpose an equally simplified climate picture
            of a six-zoned pattern. This pattern is most clear on the western, oceanic border of the
            Northwest Quadrant, and is modified considerably farther east by the influence of high
            altitudes and continental land masses. From north to south the six zones are:

            1. arctic
            2. cyclonic rainfall
            3. Mediterranean
            4. desert
            5. subequatorial
            6. equatorial (or tropical)
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The nature of these six zones is well known, but the influences that
            they have
            exercised throughout history on the matrix of civilizations is not generally recognized.
            The arctic, or polar, climate is one of almost permanent frost. South of it the zone of
            cyclonic storms has adequate rainfall, coming from the west and equally distributed
            throughout the year. The third zone with Mediterranean climate and the fifth zone with
            subequatorial climate are both transition zones and have rain in half of the year and
            drought in the other half. They have the significant difference that the Mediterranean
            zone gets rainfall in the winter with drought in the summer, while the subequatorial has
            the opposite experience with rain during the summer and drought in the winter. The
            fourth zone between these two is a region of permanent desert, while the sixth, or
            southernmost, zone of tropical climate has excessive rainfall throughout the year.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The zone of equatorial rainfall is the area of low atmospheric
            pressure directly below
            the vertical rays of the sun. Because of the seasonal tipping of the earth on its axis,
            this area of vertical rays and of rainfall moves northward as far as the Tropic of
            Cancer in June and southward as far as the Tropic of Capricorn in December. It is this
            northward extension of the tropical area that creates the subequatorial zone of summer
            rains in latitudes otherwise desert. The northern belt of adequate rainfall, associated
            with the eastward moving cyclonic storms, also moves northward and southward with the
            sun, forcing the arctic zone northward in the summer and forcing the desert zone
            southward in the winter. This desert zone, holding a position between the
            cyclonic-rainfall zone of the north and the equatorial-rainfall zone of the south, is
            the area that is never reached by either of these rainy belts, while its northern and
            southern edges are reached by one or the other, in opposite seasons of the year, to
            create the two transition zones (Mediterranean and subequatorial) that we have
            mentioned.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since the rainfall of the Northwest Quadrant comes generally from the
            Atlantic in the
            west, the eastern portions of the quadrant have much less moisture even in the cyclonic
            and equatorial zones, and it is frequently quite inadequate in the two transition zones
            between these. This really means that the desert zone in the middle widens considerably
            as it stretches eastward and that the eastern portions of both the Southern Flatlands
            (Arabia) and the Northern Flatlands (Kirghiz Steppe) are generally desert.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The seasonal changes with which we are familiar are caused by the
            annual tipping of
            the earth on its axis. As a result of this, the arctic and cyclonic-rainfall zones move
            southward and then return northward, giving us winter followed by summer conditions in
            the Northern Hemisphere. For reasons we do not yet understand, this movement southward
            of the first two zones was greatly exaggerated and long maintained on four separate
            occasions during the last 900,000 years. By \"greatly exaggerated\" we mean that arctic
            conditions extended southward as far as the Highland Zone, while the cyclonic storms
            followed tracks across the Southern Flatlands over what is today the Sahara Desert. By
            \"long maintained\" we mean that these exaggerated winter conditions continued for tens
            of
            thousands of years, probably for as long as 75,000 years at a time. These periods of
            extreme cold are known as the glacial ages.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There have been four of these glacial ages of Europe in the vicinity
            of the Alps,
            although probably fewer in some other areas. In southern Germany, where they have been
            most studied, the four glaciers have been given Alpine names: Gunz, Mindel, Riss, and
            Wurm. These names are sometimes applied to the glacial periods in other areas, although
            it will be just as convenient to speak of them by numbers from one to four. The periods
            between the glaciers, when there were temperate or even semitropical conditions in
            Europe, are called interglacial periods and are also numbered. The period in which we
            live, following the fourth glacier, is known as the postglacial period, or, more
            technically, as the Holocene. If we were to assume that a fifth glacial period might
            occur in the future, it would probabl be more accurate to call the Holocene, in which we
            live, the fourth interglacial period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Each glacial period lasted for about 75,000 years. The interglacial
            periods were not
            of uniform length, the first and third lasting for about 150,000 years, while the
            second, or \"Great Interglacial,\" lasted almost twice as long. If we add together the
            lengths of the four glacials, the three interglacials, and the postglacial, we obtain a
            total of about 920,000 years. This period of something less than a million years happens
            also to be the period in which man in a biological form somewhat like our own has been
            on this earth. The whole million-year epoch is called the Quaternary Age, while the
            major portion of it, during which the glaciers were advancing and retreating, is known
            as the Pleistocene.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;During the glacial periods when Europe was under arctic conditions and
            the Sahara was
            under pluvial conditions, the former was an undesirable place for human residence, while
            the latter was well adapted to man. In the interglacial periods when the pluvial zone
            had moved northward and the Sahara had become desert, Europe was a desirable place for
            human habitation, while the African flatlands became almost uninhabitable. For this
            reason the pluvial and interpluvial periods of African history are even more significant
            than the contemporary glacial and interglacial periods of European history. In effect,
            man followed the pluvial zone north into Europe and south into Africa four times during
            the Pleistocene era. Of course, the movement of people was considerably less than this
            implies. In reality, relatively few persons followed the rain belt north and south, and
            these moved so slowly that they were probably unaware that they were moving. As Africa
            became drier with the approach of an interglacial period, the grass became scantier and
            grasseating game animals fewer. The human population, which had increased substantially
            there in the preceding, more lush, pluvial period, dwindled in numbers and moved both
            northward and southward in search of more adequate hunting grounds. The majority,
            unsuccessful in this search, perished, either from lack of food or in combat with other
            tribesmen for control of the diminishing hunting grounds. Those who moved south mostly
            died in an effort to deal with the inhospitable tropical jungles. Those who moved
            northward had a similar fate along the southern shores of the Mediterranean seas, except
            for the comparatively small number who could find a way northward across Sinai and the
            Levant to the Highland Zone and the Northern Flatlands beyond. It has been suggested
            that the glacial age tied up so much water in the form of ice on the northern land
            surfaces that the level of the ocean fell sufficiently to create land bridges between
            Europe and Africa at Gibraltar and Sicily. It is quite true that sea levels were
            considerably lower during the glacial periods, but it is doubtful that this was ever
            sufficient to open trans-Mediterranean land bridges, at least for any very long time.
        </item>
        <item>Imageimage_6_30</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This whole process of population growth and movement was reversed at
            the onset of a
            glacial period. In the preceding interglacial age the population of Europe, especially
            on the grassy Northern Flatlands, must have reached a maximum because of the adequate
            supply of herding game animals, while in the Southern Flatlands desert conditions must
            have reduced grass, animals, and men to a minimum. As the advancing glacier moved
            southward, preceded by the pluvial zone, living conditions in Europe worsened and
            population became reduced, either by emigration or by death, while the population of the
            Southern Flatlands, largely from more successful biological reproduction, increased.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It should be clearly understood that all these great changes took
            thousands of years
            and occurred so slowly that the individual persons involved could have had no
            realization that they were concerned with the processes we have described. They knew
            nothing of moving glaciers or rain belts and had no glimmering conception that they were
            one generation in a family line that was migrating successfully or was perishing
            locally. This is clearly one case where the historical events we describe were occurring
            to statistical masses rather than to isolated individual persons.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Although migration was only a minor portion of the population changes
            of the
            Pleistocene, we may picture the glaciers as a great piston that advanced and withdrew
            four times, expelling population from Europe as it advanced and sucking it back again
            from Africa as it withdrew northward. This fundamental but oversimplified picture must
            now be modified by two other considerations. The first of these arises from the fact
            that glacial advance came down altitudes as well as latitudes, while the second arises
            from the fact that such glacial movements were not steady but fluctuating.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that glaciers advanced down the altitudes as well as down
            the latitudes,
            we mean that glacial advance not only consisted of a southward advance of the polar
            icecap; it also consisted of a downward extension of the snow line on mountain peaks.
            The latter movement, on the northern side of mountain ranges like the Alps, Caucasus, or
            Himalayas, appeared as a northward advance of ice. More significant for human history is
            the fact that the lowering of the snow line closed mountain passes while the lower
            altitudes to the north were still habitable, thus trapping groups of people north of the
            mountain barriers in the face of the advancing Ice Age. These trapped peoples were able
            to survive only if they could adapt their social customs to living under glacial
            conditions. This would have required, as a minimum, the acquisition of fire and the use
            of clothing. Since these people would have been separated from the main stock of mankind
            in Africa for a long period, at least 100,000 years, it is almost inevitable that they
            would have become changed in physical features and that these changes would be those
            such as shorter neck and limbs, chunkier body, thicker hair, narrower nostrils,
            protected eye sockets, and other modifications helpful in living under arctic
            conditions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The development of such a distinctive type of man did occur, at least
            once, probably
            in eastern Asia north of the Himalayas, during the second or third glacial age. This
            type is called Neanderthal man.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Neanderthal man was so different in appearance from most modern men
            that no observer
            would be likely to confuse them. His bodily proportions were quite different, since he
            had shorter legs and almost no neck. There were other, more technical, differences. His
            rib bones were rounder, rather than flattened as ours are; he had no real chin or
            forehead; his eyes were protected by bony eye ridges along the brows; and his head was
            attached to the front rather than to the top of the last vertebra.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because of these differences, Neanderthal man is frequently regarded
            as a different
            species from modern man, or Homo sapiens. But he is more correctly regarded as a
            variety, since the critical mark of species difference, inability to interbreed to
            produce fertile offspring, was not true of the Neanderthal and Homo sapiens types. It is
            now generally recognized that these two were able to interbreed and leave descendants on
            those rare occasions when they encountered each other along the margins of their
            customary habitats. Such encounters were on the margins of their ranges because Homo
            sapiens lived under temperate conditions, while Neanderthal man lived under semiglacial
            conditions. They both lived in Europe but at different times. Homo sapiens retreated to
            Africa when Europe was glacial, thus abandoning Europe to Neanderthal man, while the
            latter retreated northeastward toward Asia, where he had originated, as the interglacial
            period commenced. Just as we associated the movements of Homo sapiens with the movements
            of a glacial piston that ejected him from Europe or sucked him back from Africa, so we
            could associate the movements of the same piston with Neanderthal man, who came into
            Europe with the glacier and retreated with it toward northern Asia when it departed.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because of the conceit of normal egotism, it is customary to regard
            Homo sapiens as of
            higher intellectual capacity than Neanderthal man. This is a matter on which real
            evidence is scanty, but the evidence that is available would clearly indicate that
            Neanderthal man was at least as intelligent as Homo sapiens. This evidence includes the
            following: Neanderthal man possessed both fire and clothing, necessities for glacial
            living, before Homo sapiens did. He seems to have buried his dead, leaving with the body
            equipment needed in some future life, at an earlier period, thus giving evidence of an
            earlier recognition of spiritual values. His tools were frequently made in greater
            variety and with somewhat greater skill, and include the earliest compound tools (in
            which the blade and handle were separate pieces). But these achievements, which might be
            interpreted to indicate a fairly high level of brain power, apparently do not indicate
            sufficient mental flexibility to permit Neanderthal man to survive the ending of glacial
            conditions. By adapting his way of life so successfully to glacial conditions and to the
            pursuit of the great glacial mammals such as mammoths, Neanderthal man made his way of
            life too rigid to permit him to exist under postglacial conditions when such mammals
            became extinct.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have suggested that Neanderthal man developed as an offshoot from
            the main line of
            human evolution by being trapped by a glacial age north of the mountains in Asia. We do
            not know whether the glacier that did this was the second (Mindel) or the third (Riss),
            but it is clear that Neanderthal man was alone in Europe during the early portion of the
            fourth, Wurm, glacier.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The fourth glacier had two icy peaks known as Wurm I and Wurm II. The
            interval between
            them, known as Achen, occurred when the glacier withdrew part way and then returned with
            full intensity in the phase called Wurm II (or Buhl). The withdrawal of Wurm I gave rise
            to the usual population movements that we have posited of a glacial retreat, Neanderthal
            man withdrawing toward Asia while Homo sapiens began to move to Europe from Africa. With
            the return of Wurm II, this process was reversed; but this time, probably for the first
            time, some Homo sapiens groups were able to remain in Europe under glacial conditions by
            adopting the techniques of fire, fur clothing, and cave dwelling that had been developed
            by Neanderthal man. Thus, for the first time, especially during the early stages of the
            withdrawal of Wurm II, Homo sapiens and Neanderthal man came into close biological
            contact, with consequent interbreeding. This occurred on the fringes of Asia and Europe,
            north and east of the Mediterranean Sea, and may have occurred south of the sea in parts
            of North Africa. As a consequence, the early postglacial period found three human types
            in the Northwest Quadrant, Neanderthal in northern Europe retreating toward Asia, Homo
            sapiens in the Southern Flatlands moving toward Asia and Europe (largely by way of the
            Levant), and a mixed group in between, chiefly in the Highland Zone of the Caucasus and
            Iran. It is probable that we owe the later existence of a stocky, roundheaded,
            agglutinative-speaking people in the Highland Zone to the existence of this mixed group.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This does not mean that the mixed group stayed in the Highland Zone.
            They undoubtedly
            moved along it, both east and west, even before the final glacial withdrawal began.
            Then, as this withdrawal became definite, this mixed group moved northward and eastward,
            hunting reindeer and cold-loving animals. They were following on the heels of the pure
            Neanderthal, who was moving in the same direction, closer to the glacier\'s edge, and
            still hunting mammoths, mastodons, and other glacial fauna soon to become extinct.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the same time, other mixed persons remained in the Highland Zone
            and its adjacent
            parklands, hunting such temperate animals as deer, elk, and the great European wild
            cattle. This last group we may call by the name Alpine men, a term which refers to their
            physical type. They spoke agglutinative languages of which the only surviving remnants
            are Basque and certain archaic languages of the Caucasus. The other mixed group that
            followed the reindeer northeastward were of a similar physical type, but may be called
            by the linguistic term proto-Finnish. These were the linguistic ancestors of the
            Ural-Altaic languages such as Finnish, Turkish, Magyar, Mongolian, and probably Chinese
            (now greatly modified by new vocabulary and the isolation of the meaningful syllables
            whose gluing together is one of the chief features of agglutinative languages). These
            languages are frequently called Ural-Altaic because they were centered, in historic
            times, in the area between the Ural and Altai mountains just east of the center from
            which the Indo-European (inflected) languages dispersed.

            on the heels of
            the departing Neanderthal was soon disrupted by the arrival of a new wave from Africa.
            During Wurm II the Sahara grasslands had built up a fairly numerous population of the
            familiar Mediterranean physical type: longheaded, slim-boned, rather dark-skinned, with
            dark eyes and hair. The appearance of postglacial arid conditions in the central Sahara
            split this group, pushing some southward toward the southern grasslands of the
            subequatorial climate zone and driving the rest northward toward the retreating belt of
            cyclonic storms. The group that moved southward mixed with earlier travellers in that
            direction, became darker-skinned and taller, while remaining longheaded, giving rise to
            negroid groups. The group that moved northward eventually crossed the Sinai Peninsula
            and the Levant. Those who remained in Arabia became the ancestors of the longheaded,
            slim speakers of inflected languages whom we call Semites. Those who continued
            northward, across the Caucasus into the Northern Flatlands, became the ancestors of the
            longheaded, slim speakers of inflected languages whom we call Indo-Europeans.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The latter group, the proto-Indo-Europeans, moved slowly
            northwestward, becoming
            taller and paler-skinned as they moved. They drove a wedge of tall, inflected-language
            longheads between the agglutinative-speaking proto- Finnish to the northeast and the
            agglutinative-speaking Alpines in the Highland Zone to the south and southwest. At a
            fairly recent date, in the northwestern extremity of their range, these intrusive
            Indo-European speakers became very tall, blond, fair-skinned, and blue-eyed in that
            Scandinavian type known as Nordic. Their ancestors remaining on the southeastern steppes
            stayed much less Nordic in physical type, since that type is an extreme aberrant
            probably caused by the lessened amounts of ultraviolet radiations in the cloud-shrouded
            northwestern sunlight.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus in the immediate postglacial period, during a rather dry and cold
            climate, the
            Northwest Quadrant had seven different types of peoples distributed in rough bands from
            the extreme northeast in Asia to the extreme southwest in Africa. These bands were the
            following: (1) Neanderthal, moving to extinction on the shores of the Arctic Ocean; (2)
            a mixed group of agglutinative-speaking roundheads moving eastward across Asia at a
            rather high latitude and leaving behind the ancestors of the Ural-Altaic peoples as well
            as those of the Mongols, Eskimos, and American Indians; (3) the longheaded,
            inflective-speaking proto-Indo- European group moving northwestward from the Kirghiz
            Steppes toward Scandinavia where it would develop into the Nordic type; (4) the Highland
            Zone Alpine, an agglutinative- speaking roundhead; (5) the Mediterranean type, an
            inflective-language longhead, on the northern fringes of the Southern Flatlands; (6) the
            negroid, a tall longhead, resident in the subequatorial grasslands and the edges of the
            equatorial forests; and (7) the pygmy, a very short, yellow skinned roundhead, living in
            the equatorial forest itself. Of these groups the oldest by far is the last, since the
            pygmy goes back to a very early period, considerably before the six other types had
            developed, and probably shares, in that remote period, a common ancestry with the group
            from which the glacial-entrapped Neanderthals emerged.

        <item>Imageimage_6_46</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If we leave aside the pygmy as an ancient aberrant created by
            isolation in a sunless
            hot climate, and widen our field of geographic concern, for a moment, to include the
            whole Old World hemisphere, we might make three observations. In the first place, the
            Old World linguistic pattern, in the terms we are using, is fairly simple. At the
            center, as a recent emergent from the Southern Flatlands, we find a great core of
            inflected languages divided into two main groups of Semite and Indo-European. Around
            this core, as an earlier emergent from the same prolific Southern Flatlands, is a band
            of agglutinative-speaking languages, also divided into two groups, the Ural-Altaic of
            central Asia and the Bantu of grassland Africa. And last, at the two extremes, in the
            Far East of Asia and in the west of grassland Africa, are two blocs of isolating
            languages that probably arose from the syllabic disintegration of the oldest
            agglutinative languages. It might be added that at the dawn of history (about 3000 B.C.)
            this pattern was further complicated by the Highland Zone block of agglutinative
            speakers separating the two inflective groups, the Semites and Indo-Europeans. One of
            the great events of the historic period has been the linguistic submergence of these
            Alpine agglutinatives by the longheaded inflective speakers, especially by
            Indo-Europeans, as a consequence of population movements engendered by two acute dry
            spells of the historic period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Our second observation is concerned with Africa. The earliest
            postglacial climate
            period, called the Boreal (about 14,000 to 6000 B.C.), was dry and cool. Its dryness
            resulted in the depopulation of the African Flatlands, already mentioned. In the
            subsequent wetter period known as the period of Atlantic climate (6000 B.C. to 3000
            B.C.), there was a movement of population back into the area, chiefly from Arabia. The
            people who moved westward across Africa under these influences are called Hamites.
            Later, in the subsequent drier period after 3000 B.C., a second and larger movement from
            Arabia into Africa was made by Semite peoples. Both of these peoples had profound
            influences on the negroid peoples of the African grasslands and on the complex mixed
            peoples of Egypt and Ethopia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Our third observation is concerned with a group that is now
            linguistically extinct and
            may appear to many as of little historic significance. These are the
            agglutinative-speaking Alpine peoples of the Highland Zone. This group, which usually
            receives only passing references in most histories, are, in fact, the most important
            group of humans who ever existed. They were the inventors of agriculture as we know it,
            using the same crops and domestic animals we have today. They were also the inventors of
            metallurgy (copper, bronze, and possibly iron) and were the founders of the first
            civilization, in the valley of Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From these last remarks it must be clear that climate change continued
            to determine
            the chronological pattern of events even in the postglacial period. This is correct.
            Following the Boreal period (14,000-6000 B.C.) we find great cultural significance in a
            period of warmer and drier climate from about 2500 to about 1000 B.C. This period,
            called the Sub-Boreal, was preceded and followed by periods of more adequate rainfall.
            The earlier of these, known as Atlantic climate, lasted from about 6000 B.C. to 2500
            B.C., while the later, known as the Sub-Atlantic, lasted from about 1000 B.C. to about
            A.D. 200. In these two periods of more plentiful rainfall, the Northern and Southern
            Flatlands, especially in Arabia and on the Kirghiz Steppes, had a more plentiful supply
            of grass and thus supported more numerous herds of grazing animals and larger numbers of
            men. In the intervening Sub-Boreal period, as well as during the drier period after A.D.
            200 (for about a thousand years), the increased drought reduced the grass and the
            grazing herds and forced the tribesmen who lived off these to migrate out of these
            Flatlands toward the Highland Zone and the Mediterranean. One of the master patterns of
            the chronology of postglacial human history in the Northwest Quadrant was this fourstage
            sequence of climate change that saw each of two periods of adequate rainfall and
            relatively sedentary populations followed by a period of inadequate rainfall and
            devastating tribal migrations. The explosive qualities of the two drier periods
            following 2500 B.C. and A.D. 200 were intensified by the fact that the earlier periods
            of adequate rainfall, following 6000 B.C. and 1000 B.C., had greatly increased the
            density of population in the Flatlands and thus intensified the movement of peoples when
            the climate finally became drier.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It should be noted that the dates given for these climate changes are
            those that apply
            to the Northern Flatlands (and thus to Eurasia) and that the corresponding changes in
            the Southern Flatlands of Sahara-Arabia occurred a little earlier.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The most notable consequence of the Sub-Boreal dry period following
            2500 B.C. and of
            the post-Classical dry period following A.D. 200 has been the outpouring of peoples from
            Arabia and from the areas around and to the east of the Kirghiz Steppes. During both dry
            periods the peoples who moved out of Arabia are called Semites. In the earlier dry
            period the peoples who moved out of the Northern Flatlands were Indo-Europeans, while
            those who moved out of this area during the later dry period were Ural-Altaic speakers.

            post-Classical dry
            periods did not emerge in any constant or steady stream but rather came in waves. These
            waves went in three chief directions: (1) southwestward into Africa; (2) westward into
            the Levant (Palestine and Syria); and (3) eastward into Mesopotamia (Iraq). We shall say
            nothing more about the ones who went into Africa, but those who went into the Levant and
            Mesopotamia are too significant to be neglected even in the most cursory examination of
            Old World history. These two areas together form a semicircle, open to the south, around
            the Arabian Desert, and called by Breasted \"the Fertile Crescent.\" This crescent, like
            a
            great horseshoe curving northward, has its western leg resting on the head of the Red
            Sea near Aqaba, while its eastern leg rests on the head of the Persian Gulf. Any
            movement of peoples out of Arabia by land would be into the Fertile Crescent.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There have been four such waves bringing newcomers either into the
            Levant on the west
            or into Mesopotamia on the east. Although these emigrants were quite closely related to
            one another, they are usually known by different names in the two halves of the Fertile
            Crescent even in the same outward movement.

            are simply called
            Semites, while their brothers who moved eastward are called Akkadians in the middle
            valley and Assyrians in the northern valley. The secondwave, just before 2000 B.C., are
            known as Canaanites in the Levant and as Amorites in Mesopotamia. In the course of the
            second millennium B.C., various branches of these two groups became distinguished in
            different areas so that some of the Canaanites came to be known as Ugarites,
            Phoenicians, and Hebrews, while some of the Amorites came to be called Babylonians. The
            third wave out of Arabia brought people known as Arameans in the Levant and as Chaldeans
            in Mesopotamia. The fourth wave, which began about A.D. 600, were known as Arabs in both
            areas. The chronological relationships among these various groups of Semites can be seen

            profound effects
            upon the history of civilizations. The Canaanites became the chief element in a
            civilization of their own, known as Canaanite civilization, which lasted for almost 2000
            years, ending with the destruction of Punic culture by the Romans about 100 B.C. The
            Arabs also came to form a distinct civilization, called Islamic, which lasted about 1400
            years and ended with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire in the twentieth century. The
            other peoples named (Akkadians, Amorites, Arameans, Chal-deans, and Assyrians) played
            varied roles in that most venerable of civilizations, Mesopotamian, which originated in
            the activities of a non-Semite people, the Sumerians, and ended with the imperial
            achievements of another non-Semite people, the Persians.

            the roles we
            have mentioned, even greater activities were being performed by the Indo-European
            peoples who were emerging from the drying Northern Flatlands. These peoples pushed out
            from the Flatlands in two waves, of which the earlier are called the Bronze Age
            invaders, while the others, 800 years or so later, are known as the Iron Age invaders.
            These two waves, shortly after 2000 B.C. and again shortly before 1000 B.C., were both
            results of Sub-Boreal climate changes, and consisted of Indo-European- speaking peoples.
            A third wave, after A.D. 200, contained a considerable number of other Indo-European
            speakers, notably the Germans, but the original impetus came from the pressure of
            Ural-Altaic speakers. Of these Ural-Altaic speakers who pushed out of the Asiatic
            Flatlands after A.D. 200, the earliest were the Huns. These were followed, during the
            next thousand years, by other Ural- Altaic-speaking peoples such as the Avars, Bulgars,
            Magyars (Hungarians), Mongols (or Tartars), and Turks.

            which they are known by a different name. The earlier, or Bronze Age, invaders, about
            1800 B.C., originated in the Flatlands north of the Caspian Sea and sent peoples into
            areas extending from central or western Europe to India. The later, or Iron Age,
            invaders, about 1100 B.C., originated northwest of the Black Sea and sent peoples into
            areas from central Europe to Palestine, but not farther east. As a result we must

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Europe itself the third millennium B.C., especially the latter half
            of it, saw the
            most important changes in all Europe\'s history. The preceding period of warm, moist
            climate had continued for over three thousand years, and led to the growth of thick
            forests that broke up the human inhabitants into small isolated bands dwelling in the
            rare open sites on the banks of rivers or on the shores of lakes and seas. The herds of
            grass-eating animals almost disappeared, and the highly successful paleolithic way of
            life in which man was a hunter of big game was replaced by a sedentary way of life in
            which man was a gleaner, a fisherman, or a hunter of small game in wooded terrain. This
            new way of life, known as the mesolithic, lasted about three thousand years (6000- 3000
            B.C.) and was also found on the western fringes of Asia and the northern fringes of
            Africa where the increase in rainfall was also evident. This mesolithic culture is
            regarded by most writers as a retrogression from the much more dramatic big-game hunting
            of an earlier period, but it seems to me that this is a mistaken point of view. It is
            also generally considered to be a local, European, development which seems to be equally
            wrong.

        <item>Imageimage_6_62</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;My own opinion on the mesolithic is that it was a period of progress
            to a higher
            culture, in terms of technology and human productivity, and that it was not a local
            invention but rather came in from the tropical forest zone where a somewhat similar way
            of life must have existed for a considerable period. There is no space here for the
            rather technical arguments that would support this theory of mesolithic diffusion from a
            tropical forest area, but it is possible to mention the kind of evidence that would be
            used.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Pin Hole Cave in England, just at the level where the mesolithic
            evidence begins,
            was found an Indian Ocean cowrie shell. Obviously, if a shell could come that distance,
            some of the new techniques of mesolithic culture could come the same route. Or again,
            Europe\'s first domestic animal, the dog, whose origins seem to go back to southeast
            Asia, arrived just at the beginning of the mesolithic period. This animal, well adapted
            to small-game forest hunting and to the sedentary, trash-accumulating life of the
            mesolithic, could have come by the same route as the cowrie shell. Moreover, in the very
            late mesolithic period in Europe there appeared two other domestic animals, the fowl and
            swine. Both of these are of Asiatic tropical forest origin and thus have quite a
            distinct source from the later Highland Zone domestic animals associated with early
            peasant agriculture. These later animals, such as sheep, goats, and cattle, are
            grass-eating Highland Zone herd animals, and are not tropical forest gleaners as are the
            chicken and pig.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Mesolithic technology had a much reduced concern with stone tools and
            a greatly
            increased concern with fiber cords and wickerwork. It included fish lines and fishhooks,
            nets and weirs, snares, bows and arrows, permanent huts of wicker and mud (or, as the
            English say, \"wattle-and-daub\"), basketry, canoes and paddles and, toward the end of
            the
            period (4000 B.C.), crude pottery and even some crop planting. The evidence for this new
            mesolithic technology, which has recently been described by J. G. D. Clark of Cambridge
            University, is often to be found in shell heaps and trash mounds (\"kitchen midden\")
            associated with the mesolithic\'s sedentary settlements.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the end of the third millennium B.C., this mesolithic way of life
            was disrupted by
            a series of events that pushed European societies forward to new economic levels. About
            2700 B.C., a cultural movement from the Levant or southern Anatolia had arrived in
            southeastern Spain by way of the Mediterranean. This movement, sometimes called the
            megalithic movement, brought to Europe a number of cultural innovations, of which the
            chief was the use of metal (copper and bronze). From southwestern Spain, near Almeria,
            these innovations spread to Europe by two subsidiary routes. While the megalithic
            movement went on to western Europe by sea, crossing the Atlantic waters and the Bay of
            Biscay to Britanny (2500 B.C.) and the narrow seas to Britain and Denmark (2200 B.C.),
            groups of Spanish origin, called the Bell-Beaker people, moved northward, across the
            Pyrenees and southern France, to northern Italy, Switzerland, and central Europe by
            land.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the very time that the megalithic and Bell-Beaker movements were
            bringing metals to
            Europe from the west, the Neolithic Garden cultures were bringing Highland Zone peasant
            agriculture to Europe from the east. This innovation first appeared, according to the
            available evidence, in the Western Asiatic Highland Zone, possibly near Armenia, in the
            seventh millennium B.C. As we have already indicated, the search for fertile plots of
            semiopen parklands resulted in a steady diffusion of this culture and its peoples.
            Crossing Anatolia and the Aegean Sea, they were in northeastern Greece by 3500 and then
            proceeded, by way of the Vardar-Morava route, to the middle Danube. While some descended
            the river to Romania and Bessarabia, where further passage was blocked by the warlike
            hunters of the steppes, others moved upstream across the loess lands of Hungary to
            Austria, the shores of Swiss lakes, and the Upper Rhine. Down the Rhine they proceeded
            to the lower valley whence they fanned out, going eastward across southern Germany and
            westward across northern France. By 2200 the latter branch had crossed into England, and
            within a few generations the central European branch was moving into Denmark from the
            south.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In this way both agriculture and metals had penetrated to western and
            central Europe
            before the onset of Sub-Boreal climate brought in the Bronze Age horse-using
            Indo-European warrior peoples from the eastern steppes. The arrival of these new people
            and of drier Sub-Boreal climate led to a drastic reorganization of Europe\'s societies.
            The climate change, by 2000 B.C., opened the forests of Europe, so that megalithic
            traders abandoned the seaways of the west in all of southwestern Europe as far east as
            the Adriatic and as far north as Britanny and, instead, crossed Europe by boat on the
            rivers, bringing Irish gold, Cornish tin, and Danish amber across Bohemia and southern
            Germany to the Danube. Down this river they went to the mouth of the Morava where they
            split, some continuing down the Danube, while others turned south to the Isthmus of
            Corinth and the Gulf of Argos beyond. In Argos, the new commercial cities of Mycenae and
            Tiryns welcomed the northern traders and grew rich from their commerce, which continued
            on, by sea, to Crete, to Egypt, or to the Syrian Saddle. Those traders who had continued
            down the Danube crossed Thrace to receive an equally warm welcome in Troy, whence the
            trade routes continued across Hittite Anatolia and the Assyrian outposts in Cilicia to
            the Syrian Saddle and Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These European trade routes of the Sub-Boreal period were not
            disrupted, but were
            rather developed, by the arrival of the Indo-European warrior peoples in central Europe
            about 2000 B.C. From the neolithic peasant peoples these conquerors extracted food, and
            from the megalithic traders they extracted tribute, using the surplus accumulated to
            exploit the bronze-making resources of Bohemia in forest forges. From this system
            emerged a prosperous, barbaric (but not civilized) culture known as the Great Central
            European Bronze Age. This culture reached its peak about 1400 B.C., with northern and
            western connections to megalithic Ireland, England (Stonehenge), and Denmark, and even
            more significant connections to Terremare Italy, Mycenaean Greece, and Hittite Anatolia.
            These southern and eastern connections were with similar Indo-European Bronze Age
            invaders in other areas. The whole system was destroyed by the onslaught of
            Indo-European Iron Age invaders about 1200 B.C. These later peoples exploded out of the
            northern Balkans with devastating force, and established in various areas the Celtic
            speakers of central and western Europe, the Dorian speakers of Greece, and a variety of
            Anatolian peoples, such as Phrygians and Carians. In the Aegean and Balkans these Iron
            Age invaders ended Cretan civilization forever and established a Dark Age that lasted
            for several centuries. This Dark Age, centering on the period 1000 B.C., marks the
            transition between Cretan civilization and its descendant Classical Mediterranean
            civilization, performing a double role as the period of invasion of the former (Stage 7)
            and as the period of mixture of the other (Stage 1).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Farther east the same Indo-European population movements performed
            different roles in
            other civilizations. In Anatolia the Bronze Age Hittite invaders who came in over the
            Caucasus across Armenia acted as Stage 1 of Hittite civilization (1900 B.C.), while the
            Iron Age invaders from Thrace destroyed and ended this civilization a short eight
            hundred years later, providing the limits to the briefest and least known of all major
            civilizations.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Iron Age invaders of the Aegean area, whom we have called by
            different names in
            the Balkans and in western Anatolia, drove fleeing before them a mixed group of earlier
            inhabitants of those shores, including Achaeans, Etruscans (Trojans), Cretans, some
            Dorians, and various dimly known peoples of the Anatolian shore. This mixed group
            crossed the Mediterranean and became the unsuccessful Iron Age invaders of Egypt. In two
            amphibious assaults on the Nile Delta, one about 1221 and the second about 1194, they
            were thrown back by Egyptian forces under the leadership of the Pharaoh, Ramses III.
            Thus repulsed, they scattered on the Mediterranean shores to seek new homes. Egyptian
            pictures, which show their Viking-like ships, and accompanying inscriptions give us the
            most specific evidence we have of these tumultuous events. The written evidence tells us
            the names of some of the frustrated invaders, including in the enumeration such
            intriguing terms as Sarda, Sicani, and others. It has been suggested that subsequent
            settlements of these refugees in the western Mediterranean gave Sardinia and Sicily
            their names and may have brought the Etruscans from an original home near Troy to
            Tuscany on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;More significant for civilized history, however, was the fate of those
            Iron Age
            invaders who fell back from the unsuccessful assault on Egypt and turned eastward to
            land on the more weakly defended coasts of Canaanite Levant. This group, known to us
            from biblical records as Philistines, gave their name permanently to the area we call
            Palestine.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Eight centuries before the Philistines came into the Levant from the
            west by sea,
            Bronze Age invaders had come down into the Levant from the north by land. This was part
            of the great flood of Indo-European pastoral peoples who broke over the Caucasus from
            the Northern Flatlands about 1900 B.C. As this flood crossed Armenia to enter Kurdistan,
            it split into three branches. The branch that turned sharply west into Anatolia became
            the Hittites. The branch that continued south underwent complicated changes. Originally
            Indo-European, it pushed ahead of it a large mass of Highland Zone roundheaded
            agglutinative speakers who are frequently called Hurrians, and these, as the flood
            continued southward, began to push before them a mass of Semitespeaking peoples. Of
            these peoples, the advance guard, largely Semite, invaded Egypt, where they are known as
            Hyksos. The middle mass, chiefly Hurrian, spread over much of the Levant, and are
            frequently mentioned in the Old Testament as Hurri, Hivites, or even \"Hittites.\" The
            driving rear-guard of this movement, mostly Indo-European, settled on the Syrian Saddle
            as exploitative tribute gatherers and breeders of horses for much of the Near East. They
            are known as Mitanni. An offshoot of this migration, more Hurrian than Indo-European,
            moved down into Mesopotamia and set up numerous local kingships known as Kassites
            (1650-1300). These peoples were gradually absorbed into the basically Semitic population
            of the river valley over the next few centuries.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;East of Mesopotamia, where the later Iron Age invasions did not reach,
            the influence
            of the earlier Bronze Age invasions are well known. In the first three centuries of the
            second millennium these peoples moved southward and eastward from the Caspian Steppes.
            Those who settled in Iran were known later as Medes and Persians, but played no great
            role in history until the sixth century B.C. when they took over political domination of
            Mesopotamian civilization from the Chaldeans in the last stages of that civilization.
            Further east the Bronze Age invaders of India, known as Aryans, destroyed the Indus
            civilization and instigated a period of turmoil that was Stage 7 of Indic civilization
            and Stage 1 of Hindu civilization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The events described in this chapter, performed on the three-zoned
            Northwest Quadrant
            within a chronology based on climate changes, form the matrix in which the earliest
            civilizations evolved. These events, examined in detail with careful attention to brief
            periods or to small areas, probably seem very confused. But organized in terms of the
            whole history of the Quadrant during the Quaternary Age, as we have tried to do, these
            events begin to assume relatively simple patterns. During the Pleistocene period there
            came into existence the triple-layered linguistic and physical pattern that we have
            described. During the Holocene this pattern was somewhat complicated, but the chief
            event was the invention of agriculture, metallurgy, and civilized living by the Highland
            Zone peoples and the subsequent linguistic and cultural submergence of these peoples by
            inflective-speaking longheaded pastoralists pushed in waves from the Flatlands by the
            two postglacial dry periods. One of the chief results of this process, a result seen
            perhaps most clearly in Europe, was to create a political and social structure in which
            patriarchal, warlike, horse-loving, sky-worshiping, honorseeking Indo-Europeans were
            established as a ruling class over peaceful, earth-loving, fertility-dominated,
            femaleoriented peasant peoples. This pattern, first established in central Europe almost
            four thousand years ago, was not destroyed, in spite of Rome, Christianity, and later
            migrations, until the appearance of industrialized urban society in the last four
            generations.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The degree to which civilizations conform to the sevenstage pattern,
            and the
            distortions made in these stages by the matrix in which each civilization is embedded,
            can be seen by examining the historical evolution of various civilizations. In this
            chapter we shall try to do this for the first civilization that ever existed, the one
            founded by the Sumerians in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have pointed out that the peasants of the Neolithic Garden cultures
            practiced
            shifting cultivation, tilling the soil in an area for seven or eight years until the
            fertility of their fields was reduced sufficiently to curtail their crop yields and make
            it advantageous to abandon their huts and move on a short distance to more productive
            fields. In general these peasant peoples followed the hilly edges of the Highland Zone,
            avoiding heavily forested areas or the steeper slopes, and clinging rather to the lower
            valleys, parklands, or loess lands. Although they could cut down forest trees, it was
            easier to use more open areas; above all, it was necessary to settle near water, either
            from springs or from local streams.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Eventually some of these peoples came into the alluvial river valleys,
            including that
            of the Tigris-Euphrates system. Here conditions were quite different from what they were
            on the flanks of the hills above these streams. The annual flood, whose sediment
            replaced the nutritive elements taken from the soil by cropping, made possible, for the
            first time, permanent settlements and thus the foundation of city life and civilized
            living. But the same flood that made the valley fertile made living in it dangerous and
            precarious. It takes an imaginative effort on our part to picture the minds of these
            early peasants who were ignorant of what we take to be self-evident. They had no
            calendars or other methods for keeping track of time; in fact they hardly recognized the
            existence of time as we know it. They knew nothing of the year or of the movements of
            the earth that determine it; they had no knowledge of the causes of the flood and, at
            the beginning, may not even have recognized that it was periodic. Above all, they could
            not have imagined any connection between the movements of the sun and the arrival of the
            flood.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, as can be seen in the archaeological evidence, the flood
            struck
            unexpectedly and brought destruction, death, and fear, along with its fertilizing
            sediment. At Ur, in the lower valley, Sir Leonard Woolley found evidence of human
            residence both below and above a layer of flood deposited clay, from eight to fourteen
            feet thick, laid down by a great prehistoric inundation which had covered about 40,000
            square miles of valley. Sir Leonard believed that this might have been the Deluge of the
            Bible, about 3600 B.C., but this view has not been generally accepted. There is no need
            to accept it, for similar, if perhaps less devastating, floods must have been a frequent
            occurrence in these valleys.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have no knowledge of how the early peasant residents of Mesopotamia
            dealt with this
            problem or with another, similar, one. The excess of water in the valley at one season
            was balanced by a deficiency of water during much of the growing season, so that
            irrigation was almost as urgent as flood control. For projects such as these the early
            peasant peoples lacked both knowledge and capital. No individuals, families, or small
            groups of families could find the economic surplus or the social organization that would
            permit them to construct such projects.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, for a long time, the peasant inhabitants of the valley
            must have lived a
            precarious life, perhaps keeping their homes on the higher sites that were less
            frequently flooded, while their fields were down in the flood plain itself. But
            eventually, possibly before 5000 B.C., a social organization capable of accumulating an
            economic surplus and able to direct its application to productive projects came into
            existence. The nature of this organization in the prehistoric period must be inferred
            from the evidence available about such an organization in the earliest historic period.
            At that later time, about 3000 B.C., in each city-state of Mesopotamia, the accumulation
            of economic surplus was in the hands of a distinctive social group, the Sumerian
            priesthood; it arose from their control, in the name of the gods they served, of a
            considerable part of the land of the community and of tributes levied, usually in kind,
            upon the produce of lands owned by others. The chief tasks of the priesthoods, at the
            later date, beyond their obvious religious functions, were the study of the stars and
            the keeping of the records of celestial observations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From this evidence we might infer that, at some remote date, some
            unsung genius or,
            better, some observant family, saw a connection between the advent of the flood and the
            movements of the sun—two events that had not previously seemed connected. This
            individual or family noted that the rising sun appeared at a slightly different point on
            the horizon each morning, finally reaching a limit where it hesitated for a few days
            before it began to return. We would say that the position at which the sun rose moves 47
            degrees of the full circle of the horizon over a period of some 180 days or more. Thus
            was born a rudimentary idea of the solar year, the full duration of the sun\'s movement
            back to its starting point. In time these observers noticed that the flood always came
            about the same number of days after the sun reached its most southern rising point. With
            this information the observer was able to estimate roughly the day on which the flood
            would arrive each year. This calculation the discoverers kept secret, for their own
            profit, using the knowledge to work on the fears and superstitions of their neighbors,
            trying to convince others that they possessed magical powers enabling them to foretell
            the arrival of the flood, or even the power to make it arrive. The original discoverers
            of this information could hardly have told the arrival of the flood within a span of
            time much less than ten days. However, the fear engendered by the flood was so great,
            increased by the realization that the crops would fail if it did not arrive, that some,
            at least, accepted the discoverers\' claims and yielded to their demands for tribute.
            The
            discoverers probably offered to reveal the time of the flood in advance to those who
            would contribute a share of their crops, or perhaps they even threatened to bring the
            flood or to keep it away if they failed to obtain promises of tithes from the crops of
            their neighbors. However skeptical these neighbors might be of such claims the first
            year, no more than one lucky forecast was needed for most of them to become willing
            givers. After all, in such an important matter, it is safer to be on the right side. The
            ignorance of the majority made it easy for the possessors of this specialized knowledge
            to use it as proof that they had supernatural powers. Moreover, it was not necessary to
            convince a majority or even many of the neighbors. If any small number contributed, a
            surplus would accumulate which could be used, in the form of floodprotection embankments
            or irrigation ditches, to provide very concrete evidence that it was worthwhile to
            belong to the new organization. Thus came into existence the central institution of
            ancient Mesopotamia—the Sumerian priesthood.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This priesthood became a closed group, able to control enormous wealth
            and incomes,
            and concerned very largely with the study of the solar and astronomical periodicities on
            which their influence was orginally based. With the surplus thus created, the priesthood
            was able to command human labor in large amounts and to direct this labor from the
            simple tillage of the peasant peoples to the diversified and specialized activities that
            constitute civilized living. Above all, this centralized direction provided the system
            of flood control and irrigation on which all subsequent progress was founded. Similarly,
            these priest-controlled surpluses provided the capital for the many inventions of the
            age of expansion of Mesopotamian civilization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Mesopotamian civilization began with a period of mixture, although
            this occurred at
            such an early date that we must, once again, work from inference. We have already
            mentioned the fact that the sexagesimal number system of Mesopotamia in the historic
            period must have arisen from a fusion of a decimal system and a duodecimal system, and
            possibly of a third element based on twenty. The widespread evidence for the very early
            duodecimal system, especially in the diffusion of the practice of dividing into twelve
            parts the wide band of fixed stars through which the sun passes in its annual revolution
            (the zodiac), and the association of this feature with painted pottery gardening would
            indicate that the duodecimal system was a characteristic of the Highland Zone neolithic
            peasant cultures. The decimal usage probably came from the Semite peoples within the
            Fertile Crescent. If a vigesimal system also entered into the mixture, it might have
            come from the south or southeast, for there seem to be, in the substrata of Mesopotamian
            culture, elements of tropical forest origin from this direction. Of course, these
            tropical forest elements, including the use of the dugout canoe and of certain vegetally
            reproduced plants (especially the date palm), may have come into Mesopotamia somewhat
            earlier with the diffusion of those forest-dwelling traits that went to make up the
            European mesolithic cultures. The chief reason for attributing these elements to the
            period of mixture of Mesopotamian civilization is the very powerful one that no
            archaeological evidence for these elements or for any human habitation of the lower
            valley earlier than the Neolithic Garden occupation of the upper valley has been found.
            Yet the fact that Mesopotamia received tropical livestock like fowl and swine about the
            same time that it received the Highland Zone herd animals, as well as the fact that
            neither came from the Semites, makes it necessary to postulate a third element, of
            southern origin, in the Mesopotamian mixture. This element may have come by way of the
            mysterious civilization recently discovered by Danish archaeologists on Bahrein Island.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Additional evidence for early cultural mixture can be found in the
            confusion that
            existed, in the early historic period, between solar and lunar deities. Sometimes the
            sun was regarded as a male god, less frequently as a female goddess; it was usually
            symbolized by a disk or a manypointed sunburst (star). Usually the moon was regarded as
            a female deity, but occasionally it was considered to be male; the usual moon symbol was
            a crescent, but sometimes it seems to have been symbolized as a complete circle (thus
            leading to confusion with the solar disk). This ambivalence of ideas on these two
            heavenly bodies seems to have arisen from a mixture of ideas from neolithic peasant and
            from pastoral Semite sources. It seems evident that early hunting people were
            patriarchal, regarded the male as more important than the female, and similarly
            considered the moon as more significant than the sun. The changes of the moon were more
            easily observed than any changes in the sun\'s position would be to hunting people
            (especially at low latitudes), and the use of the moon, rather than the sun, for hunting
            or fishing made it a much more significant object in their lives. Accordingly, almost
            all early hunting people told time by the moon, and many of them considered it to be a
            male, if not a deity; the sun would obviously be the moon\'s consort, and thus female.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When people passed from a hunting existence to pastoralism without any
            intervening
            stage of peasant agriculture, as the Semites did, these ideas were retained, since moon
            changes were very significant to livestock tenders. It is therefore not surprising that
            the early Semite pastoralists knew the moon as a male deity, sometimes called Sin, and
            knew the sun as a goddess, frequently called Shapash. These ideas, like the Semites
            themselves, came into Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Highland Garden peoples, as we have indicated, had quite different
            ideas, since
            they regarded the female as more important than the male in economic and social life,
            and had as their chief deity the earth mother goddess. The sun, which was of secondary
            importance to the earth, was male, if it was regarded as a deity at all.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When the neolithic peasant peoples developed civilizations in the
            alluvial river
            valleys, males became more significant in their social, economic, and political life,
            and the sun became much more significant in their economic activities. In religion this
            served to reduce the earth goddess to a secondary role and make a male solar deity of
            primary significance. But this whole development was much confused by the persistent
            intrusion of Semite religious ideas in which the moon was male and of more importance.
            The rather chaotic ideas on these matters to be found in Mesopotamia in the historic
            period were thus a consequence of cultural mixtures, and not a reflection of incapacity
            to think clearly.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since the Stage of Gestation is, by definition, a period in which
            nothing sensational
            happens, it is not an easy period to discern in the prehistoric evidence. If we assume
            that the first agriculturalists came into Mesopotamia about 6000 B.C., we might
            postulate a period of mixture for about a thousand years and a period of gestation about
            half as long. In this period a new way of life different from the Neolithic Garden
            culture existed. Sedentary existence for centuries in one area would have reduced game
            and made hunting of little importance. On the other hand, especially in the more humid
            southern valley where there was abundance of grass and reeds, the care of domestic
            animals would have increased in importance. As long as hoe culture continued as the
            normal method of tillage, this probably remained a largely feminine occupation. Thus the
            neolithic society where women generally tilled the soil and men hunted, or did little,
            was superseded by a new culture where men became active contributors to economic life,
            caring for domestic animals. As a consequence dairying became of great significance,
            eventually with powerful religious overtones, and the social superiority of women was
            reduced. This rise in the position of men was increased by the appearance of the
            Sumerian priesthood, which must have been a predominantly masculine organization, since
            idly looking at the heavenly bodies or speculating on the relationships between their
            movements and earthly events is not something busy females would be likely to do. It
            would be much more likely to be found among watchers of herds than among those whose
            eyes are directed downward in daylight hoeing of the soil.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The growth in importance of animal care may also have resulted in
            clearer recognition
            of the male role in reproduction. Where the neolithic culture had regarded women as
            productive, both of crops and of children, the new Mesopotamian culture came to
            recognize the male role in production of both. This, in time, led to a shift in
            religious emphasis from fertility to virility. The symbol of the former had been the
            earth mother, represented by a female figurine, or simple torso, of clay, usually shown
            as pregnant and always shown as excessively female; the symbol of virility now came to
            be symbolized by the bull. This does not mean that the older ideas of fertility and the
            earth mother were abandoned, but that they were supplemented, and, to some extent,
            eclipsed by newer ideas. The earth mother was given a son, who was also her lover, a
            heavenly bull, who was associated with the periodicity of the year and thus with the
            sun. As the sun came and went, and the crops died and were reborn, so this new male god
            of growing things and of life\'s vigor died and was reborn annually. His mother, like
            all
            women, was associated with the moon in a monthly cycle. In time the symbol of the dying
            god became the sun\'s disk, while that of the earth mother became the moon, either as
            circle or as crescent. These two gave rise to a large number of paired symbols that
            together stood for the productiveness of natural processes of birth and decay. The sun
            bull became equivalent to the high-flying eagle or falcon, while the earth cow became
            equivalent to the crescent ship or to the earth\'s intimate, the snake. The life-giving
            subterranean waters of the earth mother were given symbolic fertility by representing
            the dying god as a fish in these waters. Or, by a similar juxtaposition, the swelling
            mound of earth that stood for the productive female principle was made fertile by
            inserting in it a rod, or a pole, a pillar or a tree. In Egypt, where the mound of earth
            became a pyramid, the pillar became an obelisk. The pubic triangle, sharply marked on
            the torso figurines of the earth mother, was made into a more powerful symbol of
            productive force by attaching to the triangle a rod representing the male principle.
            This combination of triangle and rod came to be regarded as an ax symbol, one of the
            most pervasive archaic representations of natural productiveness and power.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These new religious ideas, in their generalized forms, were widely
            diffused. They
            included the belief that death was an essential preliminary to resurrection, both for
            men and for crops, and the idea that reproduction, of children through sex and of crops
            from planting, were but two aspects of the fruitful relationship of two pervasive
            principles of fertility and virility. The deities associated with these ideas are known,
            in general terms, as the earth mother goddess and the dying god.

            Flatlands). In Greece and Rome, where Indo-European ideas were powerful, there was
            considerable confusion of these ideas: the sexual aspect became separated from the
            vegetation aspect, one being associated with Aphrodite, or Venus, and her lover, Adonis,
            while the other was associated with Demeter, or Ceres. In Greece the old oriental legend
            of the dying god became the familiar story of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, whose

            that the importance of this priesthood was organizational rather than religious or
            ideological at first. By 4500 this organizational significance was fully established: a
            new, separate group had emerged in Mesopotamian society, and this group was accumulating
            control of wealth beyond its own immediate consumption needs, and using this surplus to
            command the resources of production into capital projects. It is not clear to us how
            this development took place, nor why it occurred at numerous different sites in

            better adapted to the broad flat alluvial plain of Mesopotamia than it was to the narrow
            rocky land of Egypt, especially as the latter\'s transport needs were much more
            adequately served by river traffic, and draft animals were more conveniently available
            to the valley of the Two Rivers.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is usually assumed that the earliest wheels must have been solid
            (rather than
            spoked) and were simply cross sections of tree trunks previously used as rollers. This
            is weakened by the fact that large tree trunks were very scarce in Mesopotamia, and the
            earliest representations we have of wheels are spoked. The first of these
            representations is from Level VI at Hassuna, about 4000 B.C., and shows a spoked wheel
            on a piece of pottery. It seems very likely that this was intended to be a symbol of the
            sun rather than a wheel and that the idea of a wheel arose from recognition that sun
            disks, either solid or rayed (spoked), would roll. From a very early period, symbols of
            the gods were displayed as emblems on the walls of temples or were exposed before the
            temples or carried in processions mounted on standards. One of the most common of these
            emblems was the rayed sun disk. Once it was recognized that such disks would roll, it is
            very likely that they were first used as wheels on ceremonial carts kept in the temple,
            as the Juggernaut car was in India. In fact the Juggernaut procession as a necessary
            ceremony for agrarian fertility, ensured by soaking the earth with blood under the
            wheels of a solar car, is closely related to some of the earliest religious ideas of
            Mesopotamia.

            short time it was being used as a war vehicle drawn by more speedy asses or onagers. By

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The surplus controlled by the priesthood had to be stored, and the
            priests themselves
            needed residences and administrative centers for their many activities. In Mesopotamia,
            which lacked both stone and wood, a solution to this problem was found in the invention
            of sun-dried bricks about 5000 B.C. From this came the invention of the arch, the
            construction of temple platforms (ziggurats), and eventually the creation of the debris
            mounds (tells) found throughout southwestern Asia. The arch is a very difficult
            invention, made only once in human history, and accordingly unknown to the Incas or
            Aztecs. Used in Mesopotamia by the fourth millennium, the arch was probably invented in
            the form of the dome, of which it is a cross section. Early Sumerian huts were circular
            in ground plan, constructed of rushes and wicker wands stuck upright in the earth and
            tied together at their upper ends. It would soon be noticed that this structure would
            enclose a wider, more spherical space if a heavy weight were suspended from the center
            of the roof where the wickers came together. In this way the whole shape became less of
            a cone and more of a dome. If an effort were made to face this structure with brick, it
            would soon appear that the weight hanging from the upper center was an essential feature
            of the structure and must be retained in the form of a keystone. The arch itself could
            easily develop from efforts to make a more elongated building from this domelike
            structure, just as happened with Eskimo igloos.

            Anatolia, and was carried from northwestern Anatolia to northwestern Italy by the
            Etruscans after 1000 B.C. Adopted by the Romans, it was spread by them throughout
            western Europe and back to the Near East to Greece and Egypt, becoming the chief feature
            of ecclesiastical architecture in the medieval period both in Western cathedrals and in
            Byzantine churches. An alternative method for roofing large spaces, by supporting a
            lintel across the tops of columns, is so simple that it has been invented independently
            by every child who has played with blocks in his nursery. This was the method that was
            used regularly by the Egyptians, Minoans, Greeks, and the civilized peoples of America.
            In this structure the distance between columns is determined by the breaking point of
            the lintel under stress from its own weight. This point was so low with the materials
            available to ancient man that any room of normal width had to be supported by rows of
            columns down the middle.

            flat-topped stepped pyramids on mounds, made of mud or clay and faced with sun-dried or
            oven-baked bricks or by pottery jars. These ziggurats, as they were called, are taken as
            evidence for the Highland origin of the Sumerians, since they evidently believed that
            their gods would feel at home on a high spot, and the word \"ziggurat\" meant \"peak\"
            in
            their language. The earliest temple, found at Tepe Gawra in northern Iraq, goes back to
            about 4500 B.C., on a site that was occupied, seven hundred years later, by an elaborate
            ziggurat surmounted by three large temples. Later, more impressive ziggurats were built
            at other places, notably further down the valley at Uruk, Ur, and Babylon. The one at
            Uruk, built about 3200 B.C., was oriented to the four points of the compass and measured
            140 by 150 feet and was 30 feet high. It supported the oldest stone construction in the
            valley and a temple measuring 50 by 65 feet. The most famous of these structures was the
            biblical \"Tower of Babel\" built at Babylon about 2000 B.C. and rebuilt by

            natural nuggets of gold and copper. These materials were so valuable and so soft that
            they could not be used for tools, which continued to be, as previously, of stone.
            Ornaments, however, were made by hammering and later (probably after the discovery of
            smelting from ores) by casting. Soon weapons, probably ceremonial, were made of copper.
            Eventually, possibly by natural contamination, it was found that the addition of a small
            percentage of tin or other metal to copper lowered the melting point and gave a much
            stronger alloy. By 3000 B.C. the correct proportions of tin and copper (one to ten) to
            give strong bronze had been found. As a result the use of bronze for weapons or tools
            spread rapidly, and the use of stone decreased.

            able to suck ores and metal products from great distances into the civilized areas. Thus
            there arose lines of distant trade converging on the Mesopotamian cities. The chief of
            these lines pobably went northward toward Afghanistan, Iran, Armenia, and the Caucasus,
            but these lines have not been explored in any adequate fashion by archaeologists. Other,
            better known, routes, which are of greater significance to our story, went westward

            products great distances. By 2000 B.C., as we have indicated, intermediaries, who were

            with incised designs were being used to indicate ownership by impression on clay labels
            in the fifth millennium. The agglutinative character of the Sumerian language probably
            assisted the growth of writing, since symbolic marks could readily come to stand for
            syllables, and its full development was undoubtedly aided by the needs of large-scale
            priestly administration of temple wealth. Since tribute was contributed to the god in
            hope of a favorable flood and good crops, and payment was made for water from the god\'s
            irrigation channels, records had to be kept. Long before 3000 B.C. this was being done
            by scratching on pieces of clay marsh reeds. Soon this was done by stamp seals and later
            still by cylinder seals that could inscribe a continuous record of ownership by being
            rolled across wet clay. Slowly an arbitrary system of symbols came to stand for numbers,
            amounts, and commodities. Later other symbols came to stand for ideas and thus for
            syllables. Such ideographic or syllabic writings were not completely satisfactory
            because ideas and syllables are so numerous that a large number of distinct symbols was
            needed to express even quite simple messages. None of the river-valley civilizations
            ever made the next step to a system of writing in which a small number of symbols
            represented the relatively few basic sounds used in any language. The Egyptians came
            close to this achievement because they did have twenty-four symbols that stood for
            monosyllabic words consisting of a consonant and a vowel, and were used to represent the
            consonant alone. But the Egyptians continued to use hundreds of other symbols for ideas,
            syllables, or words, and thus never acquired the true alphabet. This great achievement,
            as we shall see, was made by the Canaanite civilization in the course of the second
            millennium B.C.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The number system of Mesopotamian civilization, fully worked out by
            2000 B.C., was
            much more efficient than their method of writing. At first they used a system based on
            ten, but by the historic period they had added one based on sixty for scientific work.
            This was much more convenient to use because it eliminated most fractions. The base 10
            is divisible only by itself and 1, 2, and 5; the base 60 is divisible by itself and 1,
            2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, and 30. Fractions were difficult for these archaic peoples
            because they could not conceive of fractions except with numerators of 1; thus 3/4 was
            written as 1/2 plus 1/4.

            positional
            notation, such as we use. In our decimal system each place from right to left represent
            a higher power of ten, the figure in each column indicating how many times that power of
            ten is to be taken. For example, the number 256 represents the sum of 2 times 102, 5
            times 101 and 6 times 100. In the Babylonian system, where each column represented
            similar powers of sixty, the symbol 256 would refer to the sum of 2 times 602, 5 times
            601 and 6 times 600, or 7,506 in our decimal system.

            based. Strangely enough it was not known to Classical antiquity, which used the
            cumbersome method familiar to us in Roman numerals. With this system calculations
            directly with numbers were not possible and had to be performed by some kind of
            calculating machine such as pebbles in boxes or by the use of the abacus.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a result of studies based on religious motives, great progress was
            made in the
            field of astronomy. Originally this interest came from the Sumerian priesthood\'s
            concern
            with the seasons, the solar year, and the date of the flood. It undoubtedly continued
            because of tradition, from a superstitious interest in astrology, and from the hope that
            knowledge of astral behavior would help the priests in controlling the credulous masses
            of the population.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At no time was the Mesopotamian approach to astronomy scientific in
            our sense, and it
            became less so as time went on. Rather it was empirical. In our scientific approach we
            have an idealized picture of the interrelations of the heavenly bodies, and we try to
            forecast astronomical events by projecting the relationships of the heavenly bodies into
            the future from our knowledge of their present positions and future motions. The
            Mesopotamians made no use of such a picture. Instead they kept accurate records over
            long periods of the occurrence of certain events and tried to forecast future
            occurrences by adding the average period between all past observances of the event to
            the date of the last observation of it. Since each observation gave them one more period
            to use in calculating the average period, their estimates became increasingly accurate
            right to the end of Mesopotamian civilization. This increasing accuracy, for example in
            foretelling eclipses, must not be taken to indicate a continued advance of science,
            since the whole system was empirical rather than scientific.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;But the results are impressive. The work of the late Chaldean
            astronomers, such as
            Naburimanni (alive in 490 B.C.) or Kidinnu (alive in 379), is almost unbelievable.
            Naburimanni gave lists of eclipses of the sun, including ones heknew would not be
            visible in Babylon; he gave the times on which these eclipses would begin, with errors
            of only a few minutes; he gave the positions of the planets far into the future with
            similar small errors. His successor Kidinnu gave the length of the sidereal year as 365
            days 6 hours, 13 minutes, 43.4 seconds, which is only 4 minutes, 32.65 seconds too long.
            He gave the length of the earth\'s movement from its closest distance to the sun, away,
            and back again as 365 days, 6 hours, 25 minutes, 46 seconds—the still accepted figure.
            He gave many other calculations with an accuracy that was not exceeded until the
            nineteenth century or is still accepted today.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In spite of such observations Mesopotamia never achieved a 365-day
            calendar as
            accurate as the Egyptian. All the alluvial civilizations were troubled by efforts to
            combine the old paleolithic month based on changes of the moon with the new agrarian
            year based on movements of the sun. Since the phases of the moon take about 29 1/2 days,
            while the shifts of the sun take approximately 365 1/4 days, it is not possible to fit a
            round number of lunar months into a solar year. Originally both civilizations did this
            by making the year 360 days or 12 lunar months of 30 days each. In such a system, both
            the year and the month were incorrect. The Egyptians remedied the error in the length of
            the year by adding five days which belonged to no month; the Mesopotamians tried to
            remedy the error in the length of the month by alternating months of 29 and 30 days.
            This difference arose because the Egyptian economy was largely agricultural, and thus
            emphasized the sun and the year, while the Mesopotamians were constantly under pressure
            from Semitic pastoral peoples to whom the moon was more important than the sun. As a
            result, the length of the Semitic year came to be only 354 days long, and the seasons
            (which require 365 1/4 days to pass in review) moved slowly through the various months.
            To remedy this a nineteen-year cycle was established in 747 B.C. by inserting seven
            months in every nineteen-year period, just as we insert a day in leap year. The older
            unreformed Babylonian calendar of 354 days was adopted by the Semites, and came through
            the Phoenicians to the Greeks. This chaotic calendar continued to be used at Athens,
            although Democritus learned of the nineteen-year cycle on a visit to Babylon about 448,
            and Meton, in 433, tried to introduce it but could not win Athenian approval. The 354-
            day calendar of Mesopotamia is known to the Arabs to this day.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The attempt to fit the lunar month into the solar year was continued
            until the time of
            Julius Caesar (45 B.C.). The Romans used a modified version of an Anatolian calendar
            which they had obtained from the Etruscans, but they mismanaged it so completely that by
            the time of Caesar the civic year was about three months ahead of the solar year. Caesar
            adopted the Egyptian calendar of 365 1/4 days by inserting two months before March and
            rearranging the number of days in the months as we have them today. This calendar was
            made even more accurate when Pope Gregory XIII provided in 1582 that full century years
            (like 1800, 1900, 2000, and so on) would not be leap years except when they could be
            divided by 400.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The obsession of the archaic civilizations with astronomy and
            calendars had,
            originally, a rational and practical explanation and undoubtedly it was pursued with
            this end in view in the period 5000-2500 B.C. By the third millennium, however, both in
            Mesopotamia and in Egypt, the rate of expansion was beginning to slow down, the priestly
            or royal surpluses were increasingly being used for non-productive purposes, and social
            discontents were rising. These priestly surpluses were controlled by such a small group
            that they could be applied to utilize new and better methods of production only by
            extending the benefits of such increased production to wider and wider circles of
            society. The priestly groups already had more of the necessities of life than they could
            possibly consume, but they were, perhaps unconsciously, reluctant to extend these
            benefits to such a wide group as to make their clique\'s existence meaningless or even
            impossible. Instead of using their surpluses for increased production, which would
            involve a drastic redistribution of the society\'s income, they began to apply this
            income to non-productive purposes. As a result the age of expansion began to draw to its
            close about the middle of the third millennium B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have said that an Age of Expansion shows geographic extension of
            the area of the
            society\'s culture, increase in its population, increase in its economic production,
            growth of factual knowledge, and, probably, certain elements of science and of
            democracy. The existence of all these seems well established in the period of expansion
            of Mesopotamian society. Its area filled the Tigris-Euphrates Valley and pushed up into
            the surrounding highlands and across the Syrian Saddle into the Levant and Anatolia; it
            even spread down the Persian Gulf to its lower shores. The growth of population is
            evident from the great number of tells across the plain and from the debris of thousands
            of residential houses in the ruined strata of these mounds. The rise in production and
            in standards of living is clearly established by the same evidence, while the growth of
            knowledge is recorded in the hundreds of thousands of inscribed clay tablets in these
            ruins. The advance of science has been mentioned already and is beyond doubt, but the
            existence of primitive democratic elements in Sumerian life must be based on inference.
            The arguments to support the existence of democratic influences in the prehistoric
            period have been given by Thorkild Jacobsen of the University of Chicago. They have not
            won universal acceptance by other scholars because of differences of opinion on how much
            democracy is necessary to make a society \"democratic\"; there seems no doubt about the
            existence of democratic elements in the earlier period.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The position held by at least some members of the ruling groups in
            Mesopotamia at the
            very end of the age of expansion can be seen in the famous \"Royal\" graves at Ur about
            2500 B.C. By that time the people believed that their priestly ruler (called ensi) was
            the god\'s representative on earth and that his intercession was necessary to obtain the
            god\'s support for all the orderly periodicities necessary to human life on earth. Since
            they believed in a life after death similar to the life on this earth, these priestly
            leaders were, in some cases, buried with food, furniture, treasures, and even servants
            to assist their life in the hereafter. At Ur the tombs, buried in the earth, were
            full-size rooms constructed of brick and stone, the latter brought from the hills thirty
            miles distant. When the body of the ensi was placed in the tomb, his servants and wives
            were killed at his side, several fourwheeled oxcarts were driven in and the oxen and
            drivers killed, and he was surrounded with rich furnishings. One ensi\'s tomb contained
            the bodies of sixty persons killed with him; another contained the remains of six men
            and sixty-eight women; in another, twenty-five persons were buried with the wife of the
            ensi. Although many of these tombs have been plundered by grave robbers, we possess
            numerous magnificent objects that were left with the dead. Among these were a
            twenty-five-inch model ship made of silver, an elaborate headdress containing more than
            twenty-five feet of gold band, a helmet of sheet gold hammered to resemble locks of hair
            and even individual hairs, numerous cups, vases, and bowls of gold and silver, daggers
            of gold with lapis-lazuli handles, magnificently decorated harps, and many statues of
            animals in precious metals.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have defined the Age of Conflict as extending from the date when
            the rate of
            expansion begins to decline to the period when one political unit establishes a
            universal empire by conquering the entire area of the civilization. In the earlier part
            of this period the whole core of the civilization may be conquered by one or more
            preliminary empires. In Mesopotamian society we may fix the dates of the Age of Conflict
            from about 2700 B.C. to the Assyrian Conquest about 700 B.C. The preliminary universal
            empires would be found in the Akkadian period about 2350 B.C. and again in the
            Babylonian period about 1700 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already listed the chief characteristics of an Age of Conflict
            to be (1)
            decreasing rate of expansion, (2) imperialist wars, (3) class conflicts, and (4)
            irrationality. These qualities were generally prevalent in the two thousand years that
            we have called Mesopotamia\'s Age of Conflict. Of these the second is most obvious. By
            the latter half of the third millennium, war became the dominant activity of the
            society, and secular military leaders of the armies rose to a social position so high
            that they were able to dominate, without ever completely replacing, the religious
            leaders who had previously dominated the society. War became, in the minds of many
            people, the only way in which adequate supplies of slaves and metals could be obtained
            and by which some compensation could be obtained for the slowing up of economic and
            technical progress. The slowing up of such advance is clearly visible after 2500 B.C.,
            although the dissipation of the priestly surplus gave, for a while, a more equitable
            distribution of the social income and the appearance of a rise in standards of living.
            This slowing up can be seen by comparing the technical advances of the two millennia
            4700-2700 with those of the equally long period 2700-700. In the earlier interval we
            find dozens of significant inventions and discoveries; in the later one we find,
            according to V. Gordon Childe, only two. These two are positional notation of numbers,
            in Babylon, about 2000, and the invention of aqueducts by the Assyrians at the end of
            the eighth century B.C. There were a few other minor advances, chiefly in military
            tactics and governmental administration, but progress, in the old nineteenth century
            meaning of that abused word, never again moved Mesopotamian civilization at such a high
            rate as it did around 3000 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Instead of progress, the whole period of 2,000 years was filled with
            wars. In the
            first part of the period, during the third millennium, these wars were local struggles
            within the river valleys themselves. For the later and longer portion of the period,
            covering most of the second and first millennia B.C., these wars developed into violent
            struggles between civilizations. The chief aim of these later conflicts was to control
            the Syrian Saddle and thus to win, at one stroke, an important source of timber, control
            of the link between the eastern and western areas of civilization, and the right to
            impose tribute—in succession to the Mitanni—on a major part of the commercial activities
            of the Near East. In these struggles the chief contenders were the Egyptian Empire, the
            Hittite Empire in Anatolia, and whatever empire was dominant in Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We say \"whatever empire was dominant in Mesopotamia\" because there
            was a sequence of
            empires in the valley of the two rivers, roughly corresponding to the sequence of
            dynasties in Egypt. Ultimately the Hittites and Egyptians, who had been struggling
            violently for Syria in the thirteenth century, were both eclipsed, and the final victory
            in the whole Near East, including rule over all these areas, went to the universal
            empire of Mesopotamia. The Hittite civilization was ended by the Iron Age invaders of
            the twelfth century B.C., while Egypt, which had a shorter Age of Conquest but a much
            longer Age of Decay than Mesopotamia, suffered the consequence of this phasing by being
            conquered by Mesopotamian society.

            view, we find an
            extraordinary parallel. This parallel was distorted by two, relatively minor,
            differences. Mesopotamia was older than Egypt and thus entered upon its Age of Conflict
            somewhat earlier (2500 B.C., as compared to 2200 B.C.), but, being politically disunited
            and in an exposed geographic position, had a much longer Age of Conflict and a very much
            shorter Age of Decay. Egypt\'s protected geographic position, which allowed it to decay
            without much outside interference for a long time, fell to the Greeks without even a
            token resistance in 334 B.C., while Mesopotamia, which had reached its Age of Universal
            Empire so much later, had only a brief Age of Decay and accordingly still had sufficient
            vitality to put up a vigorous resistance to Alexander\'s invasion before it also
            succumbed in 333 B.C.

            of pastoral
            intruders, the Hyksos in Egypt and the Kassites in Mesopotamia, both shortly after 1700
            B.C. In Egypt the Hyksos remained a people apart, with their center outside Egypt itself
            (at Avaris in Sinai) and occupying only a portion of the Delta for exploitative
            purposes; they were more easily expelled, about 1567, and Egypt resumed its autonomous
            evolution, achieving its full universal empire in what we call the New Kingdom (1570-
            1166).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Mesopotamia the process was more prolonged. The preliminary core
            empire of the
            Akkadians (2250-2150) was overthrown to be followed by another Semitic intrusion (the
            Amorites), and a second preliminary core empire of Semitic domination centered at
            Babylon. This latter state, whose best known ruler was the famous Hammurabi (1728-
            1686), was never firmly established, and the intrusion of the Kassites, a generation
            later, broke Mesopotamia up into conflicting political units once more. Only after
            centuries of interminable struggles did a real universal empire emerge under the
            Assyrians. Armed with iron weapons and employing a policy of ruthless militarism,
            peripheral Assyria emerged from the hill country north of the river valley in the ninth
            century B.C. Under Tiglath-Pileser I (1114-1076) and Ashurnasirpal II (883-859) they
            conquered the area between Armenia, the Tigris, and Syria. The methods they used have

            Mesopotamian, and Hittite civilizations and the frequent incursions of these powerful
            cultures into its core area, Canaanite society has the most distorted sequence of stages
            of any civilization we shall discuss. Of its importance there can be no doubt, since it
            contributed much to later peoples, including the alphabet and two great religions. But
            its basic unity as a single society is frequently missed because of emphasis placed on
            geographic areas, linguistic groupings, political units, or religious groups. The
            situation is further complicated by the fact that its universal empire (Carthage) was so
            distant as to justify to many students a completely isolated treatment from the core
            area (the Levant) whence it arose.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The instrument of expansion of Canaanite society is also a source of
            difficulty
            because it is a type of economic organization so familiar to us that it is taken as a
            matter of course without the emphasis which is placed, for example, on Mesopotamian
            temple administration or the domination of Egyptian economic life by the Pharaonic
            state. The Canaanite instrument of expansion seems to have been commercial capitalism.
            Thus it is similar to the instrument of expansion that gave our Western civilization its
            second age of expansion in 1440-1690.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Capitalism might be defined, if we wish to be scientific, as a form of
            economic
            organization motivated by the pursuit of profit within a price structure. Thus defined,
            it should be evident that there can be more than one kind of capitalism and that any
            kind can perform as an instrument or perform with decreasing effectiveness by becoming
            institutionalized. When profits are pursued by geographic interchange of goods, so that
            commerce for profit becomes the central mechanism of the system, we usually call it
            \"commercial capitalism.\" In such a system goods are conveyed from areas where they are
            more common (and therefore cheaper) to areas where they are less common (and therefore
            less cheap). This process leads to regional specialization and to division of labor,
            both in agricultural production and in handicrafts. Both of these, as well as the
            interlinking commercial groups, become specialized activities within a market nexus.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is extremely likely that Canaanite society developed commercial
            capitalism as its
            instrument of expansion because its core area, the Levant, was on the western approaches
            to the Syrian Saddle at the point where these approaches shifted from waterborne to land
            transportation. This point was the juncture between the demand for raw materials,
            especially metals, created by the high standard of living of Mesopotamian civilization
            to the east and the sources of such raw materials, accessible by water, to the west.
            These created a powerful mutual attraction that could hardly fail to turn the incipient
            Canaanite society toward trading for profit. In fact, this attraction was operating even
            before the Canaanites settled on the western approaches to the Syrian Saddle about 2200
            B.C.; it drew into this activity the proto-Assyrian peoples on the eastern approaches of
            the Syrian Saddle, on the upper Tigris drainage, so that these Assyrian speakers were
            settled as far west as southern Anatolia (Cappadocia), if not farther, in defended
            trading posts, even before 2200 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Commercial capitalism, as an instrument of expansion, has powerful
            tendencies to
            become institutionalized, to the injury of continued economic advance. Such
            institutionalization arises when pursuit of profit becomes dominant over the real, if
            remote, goals of any economic system. These real goals include high enjoyment of wealth,
            and can be analyzed into high production, high distribution, and high consumption of
            goods. As long as the pursuit of profits serves to assist these goals, any profit
            organization of the economic system remains an instrument, but this is likely to
            continue only as long as the trading system is a competitive one. As long as the
            competitive aspect of the organization continues, each entrepreneur seeks to obtain a
            larger share of the total trade for himself, and invests his savings, as in ships,
            wharves, or warehouses, in order to do so. Such investment increases the total volume of
            trade, which, in turn, increases the total volume of production on one side, and the
            total volume of consumption on the other side. This increase in wealth has, eventually,
            an adverse effect on the volume of profits, since profits (meaning a surplus over the
            total of the costs of production and of distribution) require a scarcity system.
            Increase in volume, by making goods less scarce, reduces the margin by which retail
            selling prices exceed costs and thus, in general terms, jeopardizes profits. When this
            occurs, and the commercial traders are in a position to reduce their mutual competition,
            they seek to manage the market, by reducing volume in order to raise profits. In this
            way profits become dominant over wealth as an economic goal, to the jeopardy of volume
            and high living standards. Means have become ends—or, as we put it, an instrument has
            become an institution. This process took place in our own Western civilization about the
            seventeenth century, and of that process we generally say that commercial capitalism (or
            the \"commercial revolution,\" in the older books) was transformed into mercantilism. In
            Canaanite society we speak of the rise of a \"commercial oligarchy\" in the later days
            of
            Phoenicia or of Carthage. When this occurred, the society ceased to expand by economic
            means (that is, by increasing volume of wealth, or by intensification of economic
            activities) and tried to expand by political means (that is, to increase profits by
            extensification of economic activities by bringing wider geographic areas under the
            institutionalized economic organization). Thus, the economic imperialism and wars
            typical of Stage 4 of any civilization replaced the earlier economic expansion (which
            also involved geographic expansion, but by exploration and colonization rather than by
            imperialist wars).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The period of mixture in Canaanite society is clear enough. About 2200
            B.C., and for
            several centuries after that, the Amurru were pushing out of the Syrian Desert into the
            Fertile Crescent. Those who moved eastward into Mesopotamia we call Amorites
            (Babylonians), while those who moved westward into the Levant are generally called
            Canaanites. Many of these intruders were pastoral peoples with herds of sheep or asses,
            but it is possible that some of them were tillers of the soil. In any case, they were
            Semite peoples, warlike and patriarchal, with a multiplicity of gods. Some of these
            deities were simply animistic spirits found in rocks, trees, or springs. Others were
            spirits of nature, including deities of storms, the sky, fertility, fire, water, and
            such. Others were gods of more abstract ideas representing the creator, justice, mercy,
            or crafts. This variety of deities in itself reflects a mixed culture coming into a
            situation where further mixture was inevitable. These other peoples came chiefly from
            Mesopotamia to the east and from Egypt to the south, but the Indo-European people from
            the north, known as Mitanni, and the Alpine peoples from the same direction, whom we
            call Hurrians, helped to contribute to what must have been a very complex mixture. And
            finally, during the middle centuries of the second millennium B.C., there were pervasive
            cultural elements from the seaways to the west, especially from Crete. These included
            Minoan and later Mycenaean influences. Thus it would seem that the period of mixture
            could be stretched to cover almost a whole millennium, from about 2300 to about 1300
            B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In spite of this great mixture of different elements, Canaanite
            society developed its
            own distinctive outlook and character. Vigorous, practical, almost crude; grasping,
            unesthetic, yet with powerful spiritual impulses; filled with sensual desires and crass
            superstitions, yet with basic intelligence the equal of any other people in history—such
            was the complex nature of these Canaanite peoples, a nature which leaves them, to this
            day, a constant puzzle and source of interest to students.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Whatever may have been the social organization of the Canaanites
            before they migrated,
            they came into the Fertile Crescent organized on the basis of blood groupings, either as
            families or tribes. Almost at once the more successful of these groups began to hack out
            areas of influence and create principalities organized on a somewhat different basis,
            since they claimed powers over peoples who were not related to the family of the prince.
            Thus, the idea of the state, coming perhaps from the city civilizations not far off,
            began to replace the older ideas of tribal loyalty and blood vengeance. The second
            millennium was still in its early centuries when a series of Amurru princes ruled the
            whole Fertile Crescent from the Persian Gulf to the Nile and, as \"Hyksos,\" were
            beginning to force their way into Egypt. Amorite names like Abram, Jacob, and Benjamin
            were recorded in cuneiform writing for the whole area. Tribal or family influence was
            still so powerful in most places that individual rights were very weak, and a strong
            family group was a better guarantee of personal safety or of individual rights than
            either personal prowess or princely power.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In this rapidly developing society there were scattered persons whom
            the documents
            called \"Habiru\" or some similar term. They are recorded from Mesopotamia, Asia Minor,
            Egypt, and the Levant. The meaning of the term Habiru is disputed, but it seems to apply
            to persons whose social position did not provide them with the protection of blood
            relatives and of the threat of retaliatory feuding by their families. They were, what
            Maitland called in the early Middle Ages in England, \"landless and kin-shattered men.\"
            The cause of this \"kin-shattered\" condition which left the Habiru in a precarious
            social
            condition is fairly clear. Any individual who had killed a member of his own family
            obviously lost the protection of that family and became socially isolated. Or again, any
            person who had made a formal agreement to become the bondsman of another had voluntarily
            renounced the protection of his blood relatives. Similarly, men who bound themselves to
            fight for money could not expect their families to stand by prepared to avenge any
            injuries they might suffer in their combats. Such persons, without family to protect
            them or to force the prince to extend his protection, needed some other protector. This
            was found by seeking the favor of Yahveh, the God of mercy, one of the lesser deities in
            the numerous Canaanite pantheon. Such allegiance to Yahveh by bondsmen, murderers, or
            other \"kin-shattered\" persons did not originally imply any renunciation of the other
            deities in the Canaanite pantheon, and the Habiru continued to worship, as seemed fit,
            the other Canaanite Baals, working downward from the greatest, El, God of justice and
            Creator of the world. The economic activities of these Habiru were probably not much
            different from those of other Canaanites. But two comments might be made. As persons
            with weak or no kinship ties they probably wandered about from place to place more
            readily than other Canaanites. And there clearly seems to be, among the Habiru, a large
            proportion of wandering metalworkers and musicmakers. Some of these metalworkers were
            known as Kenites, a name traditionally derived from Cain, the son of Adam. It is worth
            noting that the mark the Lord put upon Cain was not a mark of damnation, as some
            believe, but a mark of protection: \"the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest any who came upon
            him should kill him.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It would appear thus that the Habiru who became the worshipers of
            Yahveh and later
            strict monotheists began as a legal or social group, later (at the time of Moses) became
            a religious group, and still later (at the time of Joshua) began to develop into a
            political group. Much later, after the Assyrian destruction of the Hebrew state, they
            became, once more, primarily a religious group, although there always were tendencies to
            become a political group (by establishing Hebrew rule in some area) or to become a
            biological group (by insisting on endogamy). At any rate the Hebrews always were a group
            within Canaanite society and never became a society of their own.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because the process of mixture continued so long in Canaanite
            civilization, probably
            because of the very exposed geographic position of the Levant, we cannot fix any rigid
            date when mixture ended and gestation began. There was rather a series of advances and
            relapses not only in regard to these two stages but possibly in regard to the next as
            well. Moreover, the instrument of expansion we have posited for this society, commercial
            capitalism, is one in which there is no great interval between accumulation of surplus,
            plowing of this surplus back into the business, and increase of output arising from such
            investment. This process undoubtedly existed among the Canaanites at an early date in
            the second millennium, but it seems clear that the Levant was too closely dominated by
            Egyptian and Hittite influences for us to attribute much of its social dynamics to
            Canaanite organization until fairly well along in that second millennium. By 1300
            Egyptian power was in full retreat from the Levant, and a century later the Hittite
            Empire was breaking up under the blows of the Iron Age invaders. At that point, about
            1200, the period of expansion of Canaanite society was beginning.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The period of expansion of Canaanite society began as the withdrawal
            of Egyptian and
            Hittite influence and the absorption of Hurrian and Mitanni peoples allowed this new
            commercial society to emerge. At that time we find a threefold situation: the Canaanite
            pagans in control of the southern Levant were being squeezed between the Philistines
            coming in from the sea to the west and the Hebrews coming in from the desert to the
            east.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Canaanite pagans in this period were to be found not only in
            Palestine but also in
            Syria, where they were already engaged in the Levantine trading activities we associate
            with the Phoenicians. In fact they were early Phoenicians, although historians usually
            call them by the names of their respective cities. Of these cities the best known are
            probably Ras Shamra and Alalakh in northern Syria. The archaeological evidence from
            these, especially from Ras Shamra (the ancient Ugarit), shows a flourishing trade going
            on between Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Mycenaeans from
            1700 to 1200. It is clear that the period of expansion, in this area at least, was in
            full swing before the fourteenth century B.C. By the end of that century pressure from
            the Hittites and the damage caused by the great earthquake of about 1365 B.C., had
            hampered these more northern seaports and provided an opportunity for more southern
            seaports such as Byblos, Sidon, and Tyre to break into the western trade. It was these
            Phoenician cities that took Canaanite commerce through the Age of Expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;While these developments were occurring in the north the Hebrew
            peoples were forming
            in the south. Some Habiru had accompanied the Hyksos into Egypt in the eighteenth
            century B.C. When these \"Shepherd Peoples\" were expelled from Egypt by Ahmose I about
            1567, many of the Habiru remained, working as copper miners and coppersmiths in Sinai or
            as bondsmen and mercenary soldiers in Egypt itself. In time, Egyption rule over these
            peoples became increasingly oppressive. About 1300 a man with the Egyptian name of Moses
            killed an Egyptian and had to flee into the eastern deserts beyond Sinai. There he
            became acquainted with Yahveh, married the daughter of the Midianite priest of Yahveh,
            and returned to Egypt to lead the Habiru to safety. Instead of following the regular
            coast road from Egypt to Canaan, Moses led his followers eastward into the desert. After
            the revelation on Mount Sinai and the death of Moses, the new leader, Joshua, led the
            Hebrews into Canaan by making a wide swing into the desert to the east. The invaders
            sacked the Canaanite city of Jericho, which guarded the approach road from the east
            (about 1230) but were unable to cross the hills down into the western plains where the
            Canaanite war chariots were still undefeated. The new invention of lime-plastered
            cisterns for catching rain made it possible for the Israelites to expand along the
            hitherto unoccupied hills above the Canaanite-controlled springs and streams. Eventually
            the Canaanites were absorbed between the Hebrew pressure from the eastern hills and the

            of Canaanite culture was not greatly changed. There was a good deal of mutual
            assimilation and agricultural resettlement, but the chief changes were the acquisition
            by the Hebrews of agriculture with iron tools and weapons. By 1000 B.C. the chief
            distinction between Hebrews and Canaanites was religious, the former slowly abandoning
            the old, bloodthirsty Canaanite gods in favor of a supreme God of mercy and justice as a
            result of Moses\' covenant from Mount Sinai. Even this was a slow process, and for many
            centuries persons who called themselves Hebrews, including the well-known kings of
            Israel, lapsed into polytheistic acts.

            Except for a short stretch from the latitude of Jericho north to Mount Carmel, the

            earlier Hebrews,
            known as the \"period of the Judges,\" was replaced by an autocratic, militaristic
            monarchy, patterned after other oriental kingdoms, with astanding army, a governmental
            bureaucracy, and annual taxes. Israel and Judah were united into the Kingdom of Israel
            with its capital at Jerusalem. With the help of Canaanite artisans and architects, a
            great temple and palace were built at Jersulaem, and a stone stable capable of
            accommodating over four hundred horses was built at Megiddo. Although the Hebrews did
            not control the port cities of the Levant, they were able to finance this luxury by
            acting as middlemen in commercial relations between the Arabs of the Red Sea and the
            Canaanites of the Phoenician coast. Solomon built a great port city, Ezion-Geber, at the
            head of the Gulf of Aqaba and made a profitable alliance with Hiram of Tyre in
            Phoenicia. The Sabaean Arabs of the Red Sea brought spices, myrrh, incense, gold,
            silver, \"ivory, apes, and peacocks\" from India and other areas. The Phoenicians, for
            their part, began to push westward by 1000 B.C., and, within a couple of centuries, had
            colonies at Carthage, Sardinia, Malaga, and Gades (Cadiz), whence they brought copper,
            tin, and iron to their cities in the Levant. The overland route from Ezion-Geber to
            Phoenicia was controlled by Solomon, who added to the trade iron and copper from his
            extensive smelteries in the Jordan Valley and horses bred in his great stud farm at
            Megiddo.

            shortly after 800
            B.C. in the Levant, although not until several generations later in the central and
            western Mediterranean. There was growing social unrest in Palestine, a renewed split
            between the two Hebrew kingdoms, democratic and puritanical agitations among certain
            religious leaders, generally inspired, it would seem, by those closer to the pastoral
            desert peoples. There was also a considerable growth in religious animosities, chiefly
            because of the survival of Canaanite fertility ideas among agricultural peoples and
            because of Phoenician influences (as exercised through persons like Queen Jezebel). In
            addition to these troubles there were growing external dangers, including renewed
            Egyptian invasions under Necho (608 B.C.), increasing Aramean pressures and, above all,
            the continued savage assaults of the Assyrians. In a series of brutal attacks the
            Levantine cities were looted, sacked, made tributary, and their leading citizens
            deported. The northern kingdom of Palestine (then called Samaria) was destroyed in 722
            and the southern one (Judaea) in 586. The more prominent citizens, perhaps one-tenth of
            the population, were deported to Babylon, the rest, mostly peasants, being left in
            Palestine. As a result of their exile, the upper classes became increasingly rigid in
            their religious orthodoxy. Accordingly, when some of these returned from their
            Babylonian captivity after the Persian conquest of Assyria in 538, controversy broke out
            between the more casual Palestinian peasantry and the more rigid Babylonian exiles. The
            chief disagreements were concerned with methods of sacrifice, use of images, and
            permission to marry non Jews. All of these things added to the conflicts in the core
            area of Canaanite society, until that society had been almost torn to pieces by 500
            B.C., although Tyre, situated on an island half a mile from the Levantine shore,
            continued to dominate the maritime commerce of the eastern Mediterranean until destroyed

            lasting little more than a century, because there was no other Canaanite state in the
            west in any position to challenge Carthage\'s claim to universal empire in that
            peripheral area and because the social triumph of the commercial oligarchy within

            the Latin term \"Punic.\" Their organization of expansion was the same institutionalized
            commercial capitalism. Their religion was clearly Canaanite, full of bloodthirsty
            superstitions concerned with various \"baals,\" especially Moloch. This god, who was
            worshiped by throwing infants into his raging fires, was the principal deity of Carthage
            and Tyre and was not unknown in Palestine; there Solomon erected an altar to him, and
            other Israelites joined in his horrible sacrifices. This is only some of the evidence

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is unfortunate that we know so little about the Cretan, or Minoan,
            civilization,
            for it has a number of distinctions of considerable significance. It was the first
            civilization that was not in an alluvial river valley, and, probably as a consequence,
            it retained its Neolithic Garden culture character more than any other. For one thing,
            it was peaceful, something that can hardly be said about other civilizations. It
            remained basically matriarchal, in the sense that women had at least social equality, if
            not social superiority; its chief deity was female; and women undoubtedly had greater
            political influence than in any other ancient civilization. Its religion was so
            unformalized that it had no temples and, so far as our evidence goes, no formal
            religious ceremonies. And to complete a rather paradoxical picture, its instrument of
            expansion seems to have been a socialistic state, yet its people, instead of being
            oppressed and regimented, had an outlook that was remarkably happy, optimistic, and
            carefree.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The statement that the instrument of expansion of Cretan civilization
            was a
            socialistic state is based on the fact that almost all handicraft production, commercial
            activities, and written records seem to be centered in large public buildings, such as
            the so-called palace at Cnossus in Crete. The ruins of this prehistoric Pentagon
            Building were excavated by Sir Arthur Evans after 1900. It is traditional among English
            archaeologists to call every large building that is excavated either a temple or a
            palace, and, since Sir Arthur found no evidence of religious ceremonies in this large
            building, it had to be a \"palace\" and its resident had to be a \"king.\" This
            \"king,\"
            according to Evans, was the legendary \"Minos,\" a Cretan ruler well known in Greek
            traditions of the historic period. But these traditions seem to indicate that \"Minos\"
            was a title (like Pharaoh or President), not a personal name, and that the office was,
            at least in one period, an elective rather than a hereditary one. Homer tells us quite
            specifically that Minos served for nine years, so that he could have been a
            nonhereditary magistrate. This is supported by the evidence from the palace itself,
            since there is little trace of a personal ruler or of any effort to concentrate power,
            prestige, or honor about any single individual. Sir Arthur Evans called a small room
            containing a stone chair the \"throne room,\" but the small size both of room and chair
            make it look rather like a place where someone might sit down in the morning to tie his
            shoelaces. There is a great deal of art in the palace, but none of it could be
            interpreted as \"monarchial.\" In fact pictures of individuals, especially males, are
            rather rare. There are some representations of females dressed in what, even today,
            would be considered daring costumes, but most of the pictures are of nature in its most
            beautiful moods: the sea, shot through with sparkling sunlight and enlivened with fish,
            squid, and other forms of marine life; or lake shores with flowers and birds; or wild
            life in the countryside. Human figures appear occasionally, especially in connection
            with athletic events, notably with a rodeolike scene in which youths and maidens vault
            over the head of a bull by grasping its horns and somersaulting over its head, to land
            on its back—facing rearward—and hop off. This latter scene is frequently explained as a
            religious ceremony, and it may well be—but here, as elsewhere, there is no
            centralization of personality such as would almost inevitably appear in a monarchial
            regime and which is so obvious in other socialistic civilizations such as the Egyptian,
            the Andean, or the Russian.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The period of mixture of Cretan society goes back almost to the first
            settlements on
            the island, and may continue as late as the third millennium. Rough dates could be set
            from before 3500 B.C. (perhaps as early as 4000) to after 3000. The elements that came
            together on this small island of Crete were (1) a mixed group from Anatolia who may have
            been in the mesolithic cultural stage, with a few early domestic animals and pottery
            made to look like leather bags; (2) a Neolithic Garden culture of the usual type, the
            major ingredient in the subsequent Cretan culture; (3) a significant Asiatic influence,
            possibly associated with the megalithic diffusion, bringing knowledge of metals; and (4)
            an Egyptian influence, which is sometimes attributed, without evidence, to refugees from
            the unification of Egypt by Menes, just before 3000 B.C. The last two of these
            influences continued to flow for much of the early portion of Minoan history, so that
            Cretan art, for example, continued to show Egyptian influences, while Minoan writing,
            like that of Mesopotamia, was made by impressions on clay tablets.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These civilizing influences did not change the basic Neolithic Garden
            foundation of
            Cretan culture except by building upon it, and the new society remained peaceful and
            cooperative. The most significant question, which to my knowledge has never been
            answered (or even asked), is how it was possible for a nonalluvial garden culture to
            adopt the fully sedentary life necessary for civilized existence. In a blunt sentence:
            Why did not the early Minoans exhaust the fertility of the soil and have to shift their
            fields as their neolithic ancestors did? The answer probably is that they developed a
            new diet which put less pressure on soil fertility. This diet was based on olive oil,
            grape wine, fish, and wheat, and proved so successful that it has remained the staple
            diet of the Mediterranean area to the present time. It is a very significant diet in a
            number of ways beyond its biologic adequacy for man: two of its elements were liquids,
            obtained from perennial plantings, while a third was derived from the sea. Oil and wine
            required sedentary farming and, at the same time, created a demand for pottery
            containers, which undoubtedly gave an impulse to craft specialization in this direction.
            In the palace at Cnossus was row after row of man-high pottery jars that had been filled
            with oil, wine, and wheat. The use of fish for the protein element in their diet served
            to tie the economy to the sea and provided the watercraft and maritime skills that
            allowed the Cretans to become the commercial middlemen of the Mediterranean basin when
            the need arose. And it is possible, although not clear from the evidence, that the grain
            fields could have been refertilized by products from the sea, such as burned seaweed. At
            any rate the Cretan people in their earliest centuries began to work out an economic
            system that moved them toward cooperation, specialized activities, and dependence on the
            sea without population pressure on the soil.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As in so many civilizations, the period of gestation of Minoan society
            must rest on
            inference. The argument that the instrument of expansion was the public authority is
            itself based on inference, although a fairly obvious one, but we can hardly go behind
            this inference to any more remote ones about origins. All that we can say is that the
            cooperative elements of neolithic peasant agriculture were developed in the political
            security of an island existence and, probably under the influence of the sea, toward the
            development of a cooperative, nonmonarchical, nonmilitaristic, and nonecclesiastical
            public authority. We do not know if there was only a single such authority for the whole
            island or several of them. The archaeological evidence shows several centers in which
            urban centralized living developed on the island— at Cnossus and Mallia in the north and
            at Phaistos and Hagia Triada in the south. The existence of \"palaces\" in all of these
            does not necessarily indicate separate political units, especially if these buildings
            were administrative centers, as we have suggested. There is a basic pattern in them all,
            and the later ones may merely be decentralized administrative centers constructed by one
            political system. It has been suggested, largely because of the existence of a
            hard-surface road across the island from Phaistos to Cnossus, that these two were merely
            seasonal residences for the same ruler.

            established facts are that
            these various centers were unfortified and clearly lived in peaceful relationships and
            that the whole island, by the second millennium, was a single political unit. Since this
            political unity was achieved without clear evidence of warfare, it is possible that it
            grew up in the early periods of Minoan history. The lack of fortifications would also
            indicate that the island had a unified control of the sea and thus could protect itself
            against enemies from outside.

            acres. It had a system of baths and drains, flushed with water from rain tanks on the
            roofs. The naturalistic mural paintings were infused with nature, the open air,
            sunshine, and happiness; none showed warfare or death, religion, darkness, power, or
            majesty as were commonly shown on the paintings of the other early civilizations. The
            fertility goddess was still worshiped, but the idea of her was quite changed. Gone was
            the pregnant earth mother, replaced by a glamorous female, slim and straight, attired in
            a modish dress with a low-cut neckline, a tight bodice, and a long, full skirt with many
            flounces. Her hair, piled in curls on her head, was fastened by gold pins. Even serious
            French books call her \"La Parisienne.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This Cretan goddess was associated with snakes, birds, pillars, sacred
            trees, and the
            symbols of a double ax. These symbols came from Asia but were given an additional
            lightness and elegance in Crete. The double-ax symbol was marked plentifully on the
            walls of the palace. The building itself was called \"Labyrinth\" in the Minoan
            language,
            an expression which meant \"House of the Double Ax.\" With its numerous rooms and long
            corridors on various levels, this building seemed like a maze to the naive
            Greek-speaking barbarians when they first saw it, since they were probably familiar with
            no house of more than two rooms. They took the word \"labyrinth\" to mean a maze where
            one
            became lost. We still use the word in this sense today.

            three-story rectangular
            houses, providing every evidence of a prosperous, happy, secular free society. This

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is very difficult for us to distinguish with any confidence the
            middle stages in
            the evolution of Minoan civilization. Our natural ignorance of the history of a society
            unknown through written evidence is intensified by the ambiguities to be expected in a
            civilization whose instrument of expansion was a socialist state. Of the general
            characteristics of the Age of Conflict, such as decreasing expansion, imperialist wars,
            class conflicts, and irrationality, we know almost nothing. There may have been class
            disturbances or eveninterurban wars, but the evidence does not allow us to say so with
            any assurance. Just before the middle of the second millennium, layers of ashes indicate
            severe fires in most Cretan urban centers, but we cannot be sure if these resulted from
            class disturbances or war, or from foreign invasions or even from earthquakes. The
            possibility of these fires coming from earthquakes seems to be reduced by the fact that
            fortifications and a sharp rise in the occurrence of weapons seems to have appeared
            briefly in the Middle Minoan period. Moreover, a couple of centuries later, the style of
            writing made one of its periodic changes in Cnossus, adopting a form known as Lineal B,
            which we now know was used to write the Greek language. As Cnossus was not sacked at
            that time, although it was somewhat later, about 1430 B.C., we do not believe that these
            Greek speakers came in as invaders, but rather that they migrated in peacefully, perhaps
            by serving as workers or mercenary marines for the Cretan state.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A reconstruction of the history of the Aegean area during the second
            millennium from
            the archaeological evidence on the island of Crete and also on the mainland of Greece,
            especially in Argos, can be made with a certain degree of confidence. The Bronze Age
            invaders who came down into the Balkans from the north during the first half of the
            second millennium were the first Greek-speaking persons to enter the area. We call them
            the Achaeans. On the whole, they probably came in small bands or even as isolated
            warriors in a peaceful way, with no desire to destroy the growing trade over the routes
            from Crete to the Central European Bronze Age. By military prowess and by marriage with
            the daughters of the matrilineal natives and Cretan colonists, these Greeks gradually
            established control over the area and over the commercial routes. Although the trade
            continued, the Achaeans extorted tribute from it and were able to use this wealth to
            build a barbaric, semicivilized Cretan- Achaean society. This mixed culture is generally
            known as Mycenaean, after its chief city at the head of the Gulf of Argos. Elsewhere, as
            at Athens to the northeast, the Cretans either retained or reestablished control and
            were themselves in a position to demand tribute. In any case, for some time a modus
            vivendi existed in which both peoples could enjoy the expanding commerce.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In this process the Achaeans became Cretanized and are called
            Mycenaeans. They seem to
            have gradually adopted the Cretan diet by replacing meat and animal products with the
            fruit of the vine, the olive tree, and the sea; they adopted the use of stone buildings
            and more naturalistic paintings, but the buildings were fortresses and the pictures were
            of war, hunting, races, or other violent scenes. They largely shifted from cremation to
            burial of the dead, but they kept their beards, their patriarchal social patterns, and
            the loose, pinned clothing of Flatland pastoralists (rather than the fitted, buttoned
            clothing of Crete).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;By 1450 this mixed Mycenaean culture covered much of Greece and had
            become, at least
            socially, the dominant element in Cnossus. The political structure seems to have been
            one of autonomous feudal princes surrounded by their warloving retainers, the whole
            under the nominal overlordship of Mycenae and supporting a life of luxury, idleness, and
            warlike adventure by the tribute imposed on Cretan commerce. The political relationship
            of Mycenae with Crete and the role of Cnossus are ambiguous. The mainland city may have
            functioned as an undependable ally or it may have already taken over political power in
            Cnossus by peaceful means, either through slow immigration or by marriage into the
            commercial oligarchy of the country. By 1430 some Mycenaeans were no longer satisfied
            with their role. Taking advantage of political difficulties that Minos encountered in
            Sicily, and using their recently acquired knowledge of seafaring, some of the Greek
            speakers arose in revolt, sacked Cnossus, and permanently moved the center of Minoan
            civilization to the mainland. The next period is accordingly known as the Mycenaean age
            (1430-1150 B.C.), and represents the Age of Decay of Minoan society.

            been provided on the sea by the Minoan fleet, but now the unruly Mycenaean warriors
            began to seize rather than to nurture commerce. As piracy rose, trade declined. On land
            the long trade route from Argos to central Europe had been maintained because of
            recognition of mutual benefits and, above all, by realization that small demands for
            tribute would provide income for an indefinite period, while total seizure of goods
            would kill the activities once for all.

            of high quality,
            the themes of this art became increasingly violent, turning from sun-drenched nature to
            scenes of war and the hunt. In time, artistic techniques declined, realism being
            replaced by heraldic beasts and geometric designs. The system was increasingly supported
            by piracy, plunder, and imposed tribute. Having crippled one great trade route to the
            north by the destruction of Cnossus about 1430, the Mycenaeans could hardly permit the
            rival route to continue, and about 1184 they captured and sacked the second great
            commercial city of the Aegean, Troy. This city, of Anatolian rather than Aegean culture,
            existed from early in the third millennium, and its many levels of occupation give the
            archaeologist a dramatic picture of its tumultuous history. Its greatest city, the
            second on the site, had been destroyed by the Hittite invaders about 1900; its sixth
            city, a relatively prosperous town, was destroyed by an earthquake about 1365. It was
            rebuilt almost immediately but was sacked, as described in Homer\'s Iliad, by the Greeks
            in the twelfth century. This event marked the end of the great Bronze Age archaic
            cultures everywhere in the West. Shortly afterward the Iron Age invaders, the Dorians,
            Phrygians, Carians, and Lydians, poured out from the upper Balkans and wiped out the
            Trojan, Hittite, and Mycenaean cultures together. A Dark Ages descended on the whole
            area west of the Levant for almost two centuries (1100-900 B.C.).

            the societies
            in which it is embodied, dies or is reborn is a very significant one. There are at least
            five steps in the process. Civilizations die as (1) decreasing political security and
            the ending of law and order make property precarious and make personal violence an
            increasingly significant element in life; accordingly (2) long-distance trade decreases;
            as a result (3) town life becomes precarious and there is a general exodus from the
            towns as people try to find a place in which they can be attached in some stable social
            and economic relationship to the food-producing earth; obviously (4) there is a decline
            and even a disappearance of the middle classes (the property-owning, commercial,
            literate, city-dwelling group); and (5) illiteracy rises rapidly. Civilization reappears
            through the same five steps, each in reverse: (1) law and order are re-established; (2)
            commerce increases; (3) cities appear and grow; (4) a middle class, between soil tillers
            and fighting men, reappears; and (5) literacy reappears as a technique of record keeping
            and distant communication for the middle class.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process has passed through these steps several times, two of them
            at the two
            extremities of the life of Classical civilization. This civilization, as is well known,
            had a \"Dark Ages\" at each end; the first, about 1100-900 B.C., marked the division
            between Cretan civilization and Classical culture, and the second, about A.D. 700 to
            950, marked the division between Classical civilization and Western. Each \"Dark Age\"
            is
            the period between the five-step fall and the five-step rise of civilization of which we
            speak. In the earlier of the two, the political disorder that initiated the five-step
            sequence is associated with the Mycenaean exploitation and the Dorian invasions. Then,
            generations later, law and order were reestablished in the Mediterranean by the
            activities of the Phoenicians, and the five-stage sequence continued until Classical
            culture was established. The second \"Dark Ages,\" at the end of Classical culture, was
            initiated by the political insecurity associated with the Germanic invasions and the
            fall of Roman political power in the West (A.D. 476); it was ended, and Western
            civilization begun, by the same five-step sequence beginning about A.D. 970.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Iron Age invasions on both sides of the Aegean Sea established the
            basis on which
            the subsequent Classical civilization was to rise. In the Balkans itself the invaders
            (Dorians) came only a short distance from the north, but they came with such force and
            such destructive violence that the great mass of them ended up in southern Greece and in
            Crete itself. Thus in the Classical period these were Doric speaking areas and still
            retained the crudities of their ancestors. The chief state and leader of this group came
            to b Sparta. On the other hand, the Dorians drove southward so rapidly that they did not
            turn eastward into the islands and peninsulas of eastern Greece, and large enclaves of
            Mycenaean (that is mixed Achaean-Cretan) culture persisted. In the Classical period
            these survivals are known as Ionian, and became the highest representatives of later
            Greek culture, undoubtedly because of the survival of elements of Cretan culture. Some
            Mycenaeans, driven from their homes in Greece by the Dorian advance, crossed the Aegean
            and settled on the middle shores of the western coast of Anatolia (Asia Minor). These
            are also called Ionians, and the shore on which they settled is known as Ionia. Thus,
            closely related Ionian peoples, with a similar culture and a common dialect, lived on
            both the eastern and western shores of the middle Aegean Sea after 1000 B.C. It was
            among these people, possessing strong elements of Minoan culture, that the new Classical
            civilization was born. This culture was passed on to the later society, not only by
            surviving vestiges of social customs and personal outlook, but more explicitly through
            the works of Homer. These works, written in Ionia after the Dorian invasions, are based
            on memories of the great deeds of the Cretanized Achaeans before the invasions.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Classical civilization, which occupied the shores of the Mediterranean
            Sea for almost
            a millennium and a half (950 B.C.-A.D. 550), follows the pattern of seven stages fairly
            closely, with no major distortions of the process. The only significant variation arises
            from the shape of the Mediterranean Sea itself, and this would not have given rise to a
            major distortion if it had not been reinforced by the fact that the Phoenicians (who
            provided the original impetus toward a revival of civilization in the Mediterranean
            basin) came from the extreme eastern end of the sea.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A glance at any map of the Mediterranean shows that it consists of two
            great basins
            divided by the line Calabria- Sicily-Tunis. This geographic schism was strengthened in
            the historic period by the fact that the eastern basin became Greek-speaking while the
            western basin became Latin. Most important of all, since Classical civilization
            originated near Phoenician influence in the eastern part of the eastern basin and spread
            along the west-running seaways, the core area and the peripheral areas of Mediterranean
            civilization became separated from each other by more than the usual chronological lag.
            Cultural distinctions as well as chronological ones are characteristic of these two
            portions of any civilization, but usually the periphery tends to surround the core, and
            such extreme geographic separation does not arise. This fact was, of course, also
            important in Canaanite civilization, where the core was in the Levant while the
            universal empire arose in the West. In Classical civilization the tendency for the
            society to split into eastern and western parts was always strong; it was
            counterbalanced, until the society was in its final stage, by the relative superiority
            of water transportation over land transportation. As a consequence of this, any part of
            the Mediterranean shore was likely to be more closely linked with any other part than it
            would be, by land communications, with its own hinterlands.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The instrument of expansion of Classical civilization was a social
            organization,
            slavery. This came into existence in the period of mixture as a consequence of the
            invasions of the Iron Age intruders. It remained an instrument so long as the
            slaveowners worked closely with their slaves, often in the fields themselves, as
            Cincinnatus was doing when appointed dictator, because then the surplus from the slave
            labor which accumulated to the owner from his legal rights over his slaves could be used
            for some productive use, since the owner\'s personal knowledge of the agricultural
            process permitted him to judge where such investment could best be made. But in the
            later period, when the slaves were operated in gangs in charge of a steward—usually a
            freed slave— with the owner absent from the estate for long periods, output suffered,
            investment decreased or was improperly applied, and expansion slowed up. After several
            centuries of this, the slave system became a highly inefficient method of agricultural
            production, with output, expressed either in terms of unit areas or in terms of labor
            expended, consider ably below that of neighboring farms operated by their owners on a
            family basis. Pliny tells us that output per area was much greater on family farms than
            it was on latifundia. Slaveowners, whose prestige, economic independence, and leisure
            for political activity depended on their slaves, were determined to resist any efforts
            to free their slaves or to divide up their estates into family-size farms. The argument
            for greater production would have left them unmoved even if it had been made. Even if
            the landlords had obtained compensation for loss of their lands and slaves, there was no
            other practical way in which they could have invested their funds because of the great
            technological backwardness of the Classical economy. This excluded redistribution of
            land and freeing of slaves as practical large-scale alternatives to the latifundia
            system, and meant that the system could not be liquidated by any voluntary method but
            only by confiscation and violence, as finally occurred. But before it did occur
            Classical civilization had been destroyed by the struggles over this issue and
            especially by the vain efforts of the slaveowning group to prevent their own liquidation
            as a social and economic group. Moreover, replacement of the latifundia by peasant farms
            would have been no real solution because it would have resulted in a more equitable
            distribution of the society\'s income and ended most accumulation of capital. The only
            good solution was replacement of the slave institution by another instrument of
            expansion, but that meant the replacement of Classical civilization by another
            civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It has sometimes been argued that slavery could not possibly have
            played the central
            role in Classical civilization which we are attributing to it, because the number of
            slaves in the society was relatively small and many of them werewell treated or were
            used in essentially nonproductive activities, such as household tasks. These objections
            are quite beside the point, and are unconvincing even when they are supported by
            elaborate statistical studies. Such statistical studies are based on the available
            written evidence, mostly Athenian, and do show that the slaves were only a minority of
            the Athenian population (about one-quarter) and were often household servants. Such
            studies overlook less specific evidence tending to show that the percentage of slaves
            was probably higher in many rural areas, especially in Dorian states. In Sparta, for
            example, the number of Helots was certainly several times the number of Spartan
            citizens, even in the early period, and the proportion increased in the later period as
            the number of Spartan citizens decreased. And in Roman Italy there is good evidence that
            the countryside lost much of its peasant population and increased its number of slaves
            during several centuries following the end of the Second Punic War (201 B.C.).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Moreover, even if the most moderate estimates produced by the
            later-day apologists for
            Classical slavery are taken as correct, this in no way would reduce the significance of
            slavery as the instrument of expansion of Classical civilization. All that we require of
            such an instrument is that it be an important (or perhaps the most important) mechanism
            in accumulating and investing savings in the society. Such a role, I believe, cannot be
            withheld from Classical slavery. Other organizations performed similar functions in
            Mediterranean civilization, as they do in all societies, but the important role played
            by slavery in the organizational dynamics of Classical antiquity can hardly be denied.

            extent in
            recent years. But certainly not sufficiently remedied. We still hear a good deal of
            emotional talk about the \"Greek miracle\" or the \"Greek genius.\" The \"Greek
            miracle\" is a
            term applied to the erroneous belief that Greek culture sprang up, fully formed, in no
            more than a couple of generations out of complete barbarism. This is based upon
            erroneous ideas about the nature of Greek culture, the speed with which it arose, and
            the background from which it emerged. To mention only one point: any culture that came
            from a mixture of Cretan, Phoenician, and Indo-European elements did not start from
            nothing, or from barbarism. As for \"Greek genius,\" there can be no doubt that for a
            brief period, for a select social group, in a restricted area, there was a great
            opportunity for men to develop their higher capacities, but there is no need for
            awestruck tones implying that some hereditary, biological burst of genius hit, like
            lightning, among the Greeks in Classical antiquity, without leaving any traces of its
            passage among their descendants over the next two thousand years.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The importance of the Minoan-Mycenaean contribution to Greek culture
            can hardly be
            overemphasized. From it came many later ideas about the gods and much mythology. Not
            only did the mythology provide the materials for later Greek art and literature, but
            Homer, who came from this earlier world, remained the inspiration and model of the
            Greeks throughout their history. This is of the greatest importance: Homer was not only
            the earliest figure in Greek literature; he was also the latest figure in an earlier
            literature. There is nothing primitive, experimental, or unsophisticated in Homer. His
            poems are not popular folk epics; they are aristocratic heroic sagas. Their chief
            figures are emancipated, free from social restraints, individualistic, far removed from
            any tribe or clan with its unexamined social customs or its clinging to the routine of
            static social life and equally free from any materialistic concerns and from the
            superstitions and social taboos of economic gain. Their gods are humanistic, and their
            society is secularized. These are barbarians who have taken over the wealth of the
            Minoan society and are breaking it up, just as their own tribal units have already
            broken up. They are enjoying their new, and unearned, wealth, power, and freedom. They
            have a \"joy in life and pride in individual brilliance.\" They have freed themselves
            completely from the customs of their barbarian forebears; they have no understanding or
            sympathy for the customs of the submerged lower classes who support them. They are
            completely unconcerned with problems of production, with the origin of the wealth they
            enjoy, with population pressures. Freed from such concerns, they occupy themselves with
            self-expression and the pursuit of honor and personal glory. This is an aristocratic
            outlook that ever after dominated Greek culture.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This outlook was, as we have said, Mycenaean. But beneath it was an
            older, more
            elegant yet more irrational tradition, closer to nature and thus both more concrete,
            more colorful, but at the same time less free and much closer to magic, superstition,
            and the fertility rites associated with the mysteries of agricultural production. This
            is the Minoan tradition. From this Minoan tradition comes much that we regard as
            typically Greek—love of nature, of the sundrenched land and the mysterious sea—but it
            also provided the rural superstitions, the mystery rites of fertility, the orgies dimly
            associated with the intoxicants of Bacchus or the behavior excesses of Dionysius. The
            best of this tradition is found in Homer\'s literary expressions, figures of speech, and
            use of images. Artistic representation of these can be found in the art of the Minoan
            period and in the words of Homer. From the latter it passed on to the Greeks, so that
            when they, for example, thought of death and resurrection they thought of the poppy
            drooping with its seeds as the Minoans depicted it or as Homer described it.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Classical culture is a Greek creation—more accurately it is an Ionian
            creation and
            became Greek largely because the culture created by the Ionians was generally accepted
            by the literate and cultivated classes of all Greek-speaking peoples. This can be seen
            in the general admiration of Homer or Plato. Though this Greek culture was accepted by
            the Romans, it always remained for them an adopted culture, a garment that was put on
            and could be cast off without ever becoming an intimate or essential part of the wearer.
            Thus the history of the culture of the Romans (for example, in religion) is largely the
            history of how they found and adopted Greek culture. This history began only at a late
            date, about 200 B.C., when the Romans began to learn Greek; it reached its peak about 50
            B.C. in Cicero, because Cicero fell in love with Greek culture and acquired a deep
            knowledge of Greek thought and the Greek language (without, it might be added, allowing
            these ever to become his own nature and outlook). Roman cultural history began to
            decline when Cicero died in a typically Roman way (murdered 43 B.C.), and it moved
            downward exactly in step with the decrease in Roman knowledge of Greek culture, with
            their decreasing interest in its message, and, most obviously, with the decrease in
            knowledge of the Greek language among educated Romans. This decrease in knowledge of
            Greek by Latin-speaking people marked not only a decline in Roman culture; it also
            marked the beginnings of the split between the Latin world and the Greek world which
            later appeared as a split between the Western Roman Empire (which disappeared in the
            fifth century) and the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire (which disappeared only in
            the fifteenth century), as well as the schism of the Christian church into Roman and
            Orthodox branches (that continues today).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Ionian culture that was adopted as their own by the Greek-speaking
            world, and put
            on like a garment by the Latin-speaking world, was never the culture of the whole
            Mediterranean basin because it was the culture of the literate upper classes only. These
            were the slaveowning minority who knew how to read and write, who had leisure, and who
            used that leisure to read Homer, Plato, Cicero, and Virgil. The great mass of the
            inhabitants of the Mediterranean world did not share this culture; they were born,
            worked, had children, and died. This great mass included the rural inhabitants at all
            times and even the majority of city dwellers at most times. In other words, the
            Classical culture we so esteem was the culture of a small minority of city dwellers
            except for a brief period of a century and a half (480- 330 B.C.) in Athens. In this
            brief period it may be that the majority of the inhabitants of that city had some idea
            of what we call Classical culture. Otherwise, in other cities generally, and in rural
            areas always, the masses of the people lived in a morass of ignorance and superstition
            that is difficult for us to imagine. To them life was an irrational chaos of conflicting
            powers and forces of which the chief were a myriad of local gods and spirits.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This substratum of irrationality and localism beneath the veneer of

            culture was destroyed when this minority was crushed and finally submerged by the rising
            tide of militarism, ruralism, and irrationality.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Classical culture was a class culture and it was an urban culture.
            This was almost
            inevitable at a time when there was no general system of education (so that the majority
            was illiterate) and when all written material had to be copied by hand because of the
            lack of printing (so that it was too expensive for the majority to possess). Even for
            the minority most information came through conversation. Classical culture was also
            isolated from the economic activities of everyday life, because it was an urban culture
            at a time when the city had no real economic function, but was completely dependent for
            its economic support on the agricultural activities of the rural areas. The city did not
            pay for its agricultural imports by industrial exports or by commercial activities as a
            modern city does, except in a few cases of which the chief, once again, is Athens during
            the period 480-300 B.C. Otherwise, as a usual thing the city existed as an economic
            parasite on the country and was able to import food because of its political or legal
            position rather than because of its economic activities. This is merely another way of
            saying that Classical culture was a class culture, possessed by a small minority of city
            residents whose legal and political rights permitted them to make economic demands on
            the rural population and who were able to build up Classical culture because their legal
            rights gave them the leisure to do so. The key to this leisure and to their privileged
            position is to be found in slavery.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Many years ago I took an amazing course in which the whole history of
            German culture,
            its literature, music, art, and sculpture, was covered in a single semester from
            September to January. The most amazing thing about this course was not the amount that
            was attempted or the professor who taught it, but how successfully it was done. As we
            raced along, Goethe was covered in fifteen minutes, Schiller in ten, Fichte in five.
            Later I tried to analyze how this had been done, and realized that the professor had a
            profound understanding of much that he discussed and that he covered any topic simply by
            slicing it up into a small number of parts and giving a name to each part. The complex
            character and achievement of Goethe, for example, were divided into six portions, each
            was given a title, and, ever after, the whole of Goethe could be evoked merely by
            reciting six words.

            Greeks and that,

            surely more complex than Goethe, but I should like to outdare even my former professor
            by dividing this greater complexity into only five parts. It seems to me that Classical
            culture was aristocratic; it was clarid; it was urban; it was balanced; and it was
            mundane. One of these words will not be found in any dictionary. When I say that
            Classical culture was \"clarid,\" I mean that it was lucid, clear, rational, in some
            ways
            like the Mediterranean sunlight infusing the atmosphere to an astounding clarity.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that Classical culture was aristocratic, we mean much more
            than that it
            was the possession of an upper-class minority. We mean that this culture refused to
            regard either profit or power as goals of life, but rather tended to regard honor and
            the esteem of one\'s equals as at least equally worthy goals. It was quite willing to
            accept a goal for life and an organization of life that functioned economically on a
            deficit basis, that could not be made available to all men or was not comprehensible to
            all men, but that had to be supported by many men who could neither share in it nor
            understand it. This point of view had an aversion to anything practical or vocational;
            it regarded its goal (honor) as one whose appeal is not (like wealth or power)
            automatically appreciated but one that is achieved by breeding and discipline. It
            regarded man as by nature close to the gods but very remote from the animals; it did not
            accept the equality of men, but did insist on a fraternity of equals within the select
            group of participants. It emphasized the dignity of the individual, at first only the
            individual within the chosen group; but later, as democratic influences spread, it
            tended to grant equality and individual dignity to all, not by bringing the outlook of
            ordinary men into the select group, but rather by spreading the outlook of the select
            group outward to ordinary men. To do this it was necessary, while allowing the select
            group to grow constantly larger, to continue to emphasize the superiority of the members
            of the group over outsiders. At first the group consisted only of those of noble birth;
            later it was the citizens of the city-state. As this group was expanded, emphasis
            continued on the distinction between free men and slaves, between Greek and barbarian,
            between those who had the political franchise and those who lacked it. Only when
            Classical culture was in its decline (after the time of Christ) did it begin to accept
            the equality of all men. Even then it insisted that all men had human dignity, had a
            kind of divinity, and were worthy of respect. Thus to the very end, Classical culture
            kept certain elements of its aristocratic outlook, and never, like the Hebrews, came to
            regard man as a helpless and cringing worm. One last characteristic of an aristocratic
            outlook that Classical culture maintained to the end was its belief in social
            retrogression rather than in social progress and its conviction that the golden age was
            to be found in the past rather than in the future. This gave the culture an underlying
            pessimism redeemed by the fact that man\'s fate, however hopeless, must be borne with
            dignity. This belief in a past golden age and the refusal to accept the idea of progress
            is to be found in Homer and Hesiod in a most explicit fashion and undoubtedly is the
            result of some dim social memory of the Cretan civilization or of Mycenaean culture.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In saying that Classical culture was clarid, we mean that it possessed
            the qualities
            of rationality, lucidity, and clarity. This culture sought explanations rather than
            sensations. These explanations were regarded as satisfactory if they led to some concept
            that could be grasped by man\'s conscious mind. Thus, for example, the immortality of
            the
            gods was explained on the grounds that gods ate a special food, ambrosia, that would
            also give immortality to men, if they could obtain it.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that this culture was urban, we mean that it was possessed
            by a
            city-dwelling group who knew one another personally, saw one another frequently,
            exchanged views by conversation or letter, rather than by media of mass communication,
            were remote from the productive system, either agriculture or commerce, and regarded
            loyalty to the state and to its gods as the chief duty and chief privilege of existence.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that this culture was balanced, we mean that it held the
            golden mean in
            high esteem, that it regarded excess or extremes with distaste and felt that such excess
            could lead only to disaster and to retribution. The expression \"golden mean,\" the
            motto
            \"nothing too much,\" the idea that excess leads to retribution (nemesis): these are all
            derived from Classical culture. This ideal of balance appeared in their ethics as
            nemesis; in their politics in theidea that justice was a balance of different elements;
            in their art as the principle of proportion; in their literature, especially the drama,
            as the idea that nemesis is always the consequence of hybris (excess of personal pride
            and selfexaltation); in their social outlook in the belief that society was a balance of
            different groups or classes.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that this culture was mundane, we mean that it was
            humanistic,
            anthropocentric, and thisworldly. It regarded man as the center of everything; it
            interpreted everything in terms of human aims; it had no real concern with life after
            death or with the gods, and had no real idea of eternity or of reward or punishment in
            the afterlife. It had no real idea of the nature of divinity until very late, and then
            achieved this idea as a consequence of an aristocratic pursuit of truth, a rationalistic
            pursuit by men with leisure and with no real regard for wealth or power. This mundane
            character of Classical culture meant that this culture, in extreme cases, was
            materialistic in its outlook; but it was able to escape the ordinary consequences of
            materialism because of its ideals of aristocracy and moderation.

            Minoan or
            Mesopotamian) had a long history, explains why there were so few primitive elements in
            Greek culture and why, when these elements did occasionally emerge from the submerged or
            rural masses (as in the mystery religions), they were immediately modified or rejected.
            This also explains why the oldest surviving Greek writer, Homer, was neither primitive
            nor unsophisticated, but had a simplicity, a gravity, a balance, a dignity, a subtlety,
            that made him appear as the culmination of a long epic tradition and the last example of
            a sophisticated culture. This indeed he was, a kind of post-mortem manifestation of the
            Mycenaean Age, looking back on it as a golden age, but nonetheless writing in Greek and
            thus capable of becoming, as he did become, the model for the future Classical culture.

            (1) Minoan; (2)
            Indo-European; (3) Mesopotamian; and (4) Semitic. None of these, except perhaps the
            last, was a direct influence; the others were indirect, filtered through intermediaries.
            The Minoan influence came through the Mycenaean Age, that is, in the Greek language and
            with heroic and warlike elements replacing the feminist and pacifist elements of Minoan.
            The Indo-European was also diluted by coming through the Mycenaean Age rather than as
            the direct influence of a warrior people such as we find in the Dorian Greeks. This
            means that the rationalist and individualist tendencies found in the Indo-Europeans were
            intensified by the weakening of the social and tribal beliefs usual among a more
            primitive people. This influence was passed on to the Greeks, largely through Homer. The
            Mesopotamian contribution came across Anatolia (where it picked up all kinds of dark
            superstitions and irrational rites), as well as through the Phoenicians. The Semitic
            influence also came by way of the Phoenicians, which means that it came through a

            astronomy, weights and measures (such as the twelve-hour day and night, and the use of
            sixty for fractional parts), and considerable technology. From the Indo-European came
            many pastoral elements, including the religious dominance of a sky god (dyas = deus

            The same quality is found among the early Persians (for example, in the Zoroastrian

            group, on whom we have adequate information, that was less culturally mixed than the

            less clearly Indo-European than the Greeks, were much less rational, and our information
            is much less satisfactory. The correlation, so far as our knowledge goes, between degree
            of Indo-European influence in a culture and the rationalism in the culture seems fairly
            close.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We may concede, then, that Greek rationalism was Indo-European in
            origin, but this
            does not explain why the Indo- Europeans had this tendency. A somewhat similar
            inclination is to be found among the Semites, and there too its degree seems to be
            correlated with the degree of purity of the Semite culture. The closer any Semite people
            were to their original Flatland pastoralism, the more pronounced the degree of
            rationalism in their culture. The Arabs, who were the most pastoral of all the Semites
            of which we have adequate knowledge, seem to have been the most rationalist of the
            Semite migrants out of the Arabian Flatland into the vision of history. Similarly the
            Hebrews, who were more pastoral than the other Canaanites, were considerably more
            rational than these others. In fact, the Canaanites of the Levant had a very nonrational
            culture, so that the emergence of the Hebrews as a separate social group among the
            Canaanites was, to a considerable extent, marked by the development of a more rational
            and more historical outlook, as well as by monotheism. The generally irrational
            character of Canaanite society probably arose from its extensive cultural mixture with
            local agricultural peoples and with immigrant Alpine peoples, such as the Hurrians.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The rationalism of the Indo-Europeans appears in their basic thinking
            habits. Its most
            notable feature, of course, is the effort to find explanations of events in terms
            understandable to our conscious mental processes. This leads to pervasive but less
            fundamental characteristics, such as the tendency to polarize continua that, in turn,
            leads to the use of two-valued logic in explanations. This last characteristic shows
            most clearly in the acceptance of the principle of contradiction (the essential feature
            of any system of twovalued logic) in the analysis of observations (in addition to the
            already mentioned inclination to analysis itself). The earlier civilizations, such as
            Mesopotamian and Egyptian, were not analytical and had no tendency to seek logical
            explanation. It would be incorrect to say that they were illogical, for this might
            indicate that they violated a logical system of which they were aware. Rather we should
            say that they were mythological. This means that they did not seek explanation by
            analysis in order to obtain logical sequence back to a \"cause\"; rather they found
            explanation in a story, as we still do in children\'s tales (like \"How the Elephant Got
            His Trunk\").
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In our own development toward logical explanation, we find
            contributions from both the
            Hebrews and the Indo- Europeans. The Hebrews took the first great step toward the
            creation of our modern intellectual processes by turning from a mythological to a
            logical attitude toward the universe. They insisted on a rigid distinction between God
            and man, between past and future, between life and death, between male and female
            (especially in regard to deity), between man and nature, between the individual and the
            group, and between the righteous and the unrighteous. These logical distinctions were
            not made by earlier peoples, as they are not made, for example, by the Hindus. They were
            largely destroyed among the other Canaanites because of the powerful influences these
            received from the Mesopotamian, Hurrian, and Neolithic Garden cultures.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Similar rationalism is found among the Indo-Europeans. We might
            explain this quality
            as one of the attributes ofFlatland pastoralism. Or we might attribute it to the
            grammatical structure of Indo-European languages and, in that way, trace it back to the
            common linguistic ancestor of Indo-European and Semite. For Indo-European grammar, with
            its categories of gender, its sharp distinction of person and number, and its great
            emphasis on chronological tense, must impress upon any child who learns it a certain
            amount of logical attitude toward experience. This would be quite different from the
            experience of the Japanese child, whose language emphasizes in its grammar relative
            class levels, or of the young Bantu speaker, who has little time emphasis (lacking any
            future tense), but divides everything in the universe into a score or so of basic
            qualitative classes.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Of course, we might abandon this rather Platonic effort to explain the
            logical quality
            of Greek thought by adopting, instead, the Sophist argument that there is nothing really
            logical about Greek thinking or Indo-European languages but that we simply call them
            logical because it is what we are used to in our own culture derived from them. If we do
            this, it will still be permissible to say that these qualities came into the Greek
            mixture from the Indo-European element in that mixture. It is obvious that the
            Indo-European element also contributed to Classical culture a large number of material
            traits. These included horses and war chariots, the use of flowing garments fastened by
            pins (the toga), iron weapons (from the Hittites by way of the Dorians), the wearing of
            beards, the megaron-style house, the social inferiority of women, and other features.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already indicated what the Minoan element contributed to this
            mixture. It
            included such very practical things as the Mediterranean diet, as well as less tangible
            traits such as much of the foundations of Greek esthetics: the sense of beauty and of
            proportion, the inclination toward naturalism in art, the love of nature, and the strong
            sense of community that was such a significant element in the Greek city-state. The
            development of naturalism out of earlier geometric art about the seventh century is
            usually regarded as a manifestation of the \"Greek genius,\" but might better be
            regarded
            as a re-emergence of Minoan tendencies after their submergence by Iron Age invaders.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The contributions of the Phoenicians to the period of mixture are well
            known. Coming
            late, they included the alphabet, many techniques in metalwork and other productive
            processes (including the goatskin bellows in ironwork), a considerable amount of
            mythology (such as Hephaestus, the god of craft skills), units of weight and measures
            (including money), and, many musical instruments and techniques, generally attributed by
            the Greeks to Cinyras (the Canaanite Kinnor). In addition, of course, the Phoenicians
            contributed the basic conditions that led to a revival of civilized living in the West:
            law and order on the seas, extension of distant trade, reappearance of city life, the
            recreation of an urban class, and the revival of writing. On these foundations ancient
            society was able to rear a new civilization because it had an instrument of expansion.
            This instrument was slavery.

    <array name="content_9_3">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Slavery arose originally from the Indo-European conquest of the
            archaic peoples of the
            Mediterranean basin. Some of this may have come with the Bronze Age invasions, but the
            greater part undoubtedly arose as a consequence of the Iron Age invasions. These events
            created a kind of domestic slavery used in agricultural activities rather than the kind
            of plantation slavery we generally think of because that is the kind we know from
            American history. This means that each family, except for the very greatest, had no more
            than a few or several slaves and that these lived with their owners\' families under
            conditions of close personal relationships. In many cases the owner worked directly in
            the fields with his slaves, and he always supervised them, between intervals of military
            campaigns. Thus the owner had a personal knowledge of his lands, his slaves, and of
            agricultural techniques. If improvement in the use of these was needed, he was in a good
            position to know it. Moreover, he had an incentive to make such improvements, since any
            increased agricultural output would accrue to him. And, finally, he was in a position to
            mobilize capital to make such improvements, because he had the legal right and power to
            retain for his own use part of the output of each of his slaves. The slaveowner,
            especially in the earliest period, had very local interests, and the society in which he
            lived consisted very largely of small, almost self-sufficient economic units, largely
            agrarian in their activities. The earliest types of expansion were also local and
            agricultural—such things as clearing of wastelands for new fields, provision of a more
            adequate water supply, draining of swampy areas, the building of defensive stockades on
            neighboring hilltops, and terracing. The best known of such ancient works were the
            draining of Lake Copais in Boeotia and the many cuniculi of Etruscan Italy.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The accumulation of surpluses of the ordinary necessities of life in
            the control of
            slaveowners also contributed to expansion by creating a demand for luxury goods of
            remote origin. This demand, met by the activities of the Phoenicians, led to the
            beginnings of commerce and later to the riseof towns. At least three times in history a
            society organized in small self-sufficient agricultural units has shifted to an
            urbanized commercial society by the growth of a demand for luxury goods of remote origin
            because of the accumulation of surpluses of necessities of local origin within the
            selfsufficient agrarian units. This occurred about 4000 B.C. in western Asia; it
            occurred after 900 B.C. in Classical antiquity; and it occurred after A.D. 1000 in
            Western civilization. Without a little thought on the subject we might be tempted to
            believe that a tradeless society consisting of selfsufficient agricultural units would
            begin to develop trade by the growth of local trade in necessities, but history and
            logic demonstrate quite clearly that the earliest commerce to appear in a tradeless
            society is in luxury goods of remote origin. There would be no possibility of any local
            trade in necessities among units that were self-sufficient in necessities. Only later,
            when remote trade in luxuries has given rise to urban concentration of commercial people
            who lack necessities, does such local trade develop.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The growth of such commerce became a principal manifestation of
            expansion in
            Mediterranean civilization, and was clearly established before 800 B.C. It was preceded
            and then accompanied by an intensification of agricultural practices. Both of these
            required the accumulation of capital, based on slavery, to which we have referred. The
            agricultural expansion was originally a shift toward growing emphasis on crops, with
            decreasing emphasis on pastoral activities. The proportions of cattle, sheep, even
            horses and all other livestock except goats were reduced. Grazing areas were turned into
            crops; lands held in common became individually owned; there was a growing pressure on
            the land, and landownership became increasingly inequitable. This economic inequality
            helped accumulation of capital but gave rise to explosive social and political pressures
            such as those described in the earliest periods of Greek or Roman history. They were
            relieved, thanks to men like Solon, by diverting both manpower and capital into commerce
            and city building. These provided full-scale expansion.

            and increased knowledge. These all occurred in the eastern Mediterranean at least a
            century before they appeared in the western Mediterranean, so that it is convenient to
            give slightly different dates for this period in the east and the west. We might say
            that the Age of Expansion in the eastern Mediterranean was from about 850 B.C. to about
            450, while in the western basin it was about 700 to 250 B.C.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The growth of population and of production in the Classical Age of
            Expansion is beyond
            dispute. Much of it appeared as the growth of cities in both numbers and size and in the
            growing specialization made possible by increasing commerce. As Greek colonies were
            established in grain growing regions, such as the Black Sea shores or in Sicily, these
            newer areas began to ship back grain and metal ores to Greece itself, seeking as payment
            olive oil, wine, and metal products. Of these three Greek exports, two were liquids, a
            fact giving rise to a demand for pottery containers that could hardly be met by Greek
            craftsmen. Thus vigorous crafts activities in ceramics and in metals, particularly arms,
            appeared in the Greek commercial cities. At the same time the shift in agricultural
            activities from food grains to wool, wine, and oil increased the tendency toward large
            estates, since these could be produced more effectively on larger than on smaller
            holdings. This trend toward larger land units continued into the following two stages,
            the Ages of Conflict and of Universal Empire.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Geographic expansion of Classical civilization in Stage 3 widened
            ancient geographic
            knowledge from the narrow area, surrounded by monsters, that was known by the
            contemporaries of Homer (about 725 B.C.) to the much wider knowledge possessed at the
            establishment of the Museum at Alexandria in the third century. Part of this increase
            came from the intense period of colonization before 500 B.C. This was carried on by the
            Phoenicians as well as by the Greeks. The former established colonies in North Africa
            (like Carthage), in Sicily (like Utica), and in Spain (like Cadiz). Greek cities, like
            Miletus, Ephesus, Corinth, and Megara, also sent out colonies. The chief colonized areas
            were the northern shores of the Aegean Sea, the Black Sea, eastern Sicily, and southern
            Italy, but there were others outside these limits, such as Naucratus in Egypt and
            Marseilles in Gaul. In fact, the Greeks penetrated almost everywhere except the
            Tyrrhenian Sea, including northwestern Italy and Corsica, where they were excluded by
            the Etruscans, and west of Sicily, where they were excluded by the Phoenicians and
            Carthaginians.

            between Persian pressure from the east and Carthaginian pressure from the west. Since
            the Persian fleet was largely Phoenician, this pressure on Classical civilization, from
            both east and west, was pressure from Canaanite culture. This pressure was greatly
            relieved in 480 B.C. when the western Greeks, led by Syracuse, defeated the
            Carthaginians at Himera in Sicily and the eastern Greeks, led by Athens, defeated the
            Persian fleet at Salamis. As a result of these battles Classical civilization was free

            and, later, of Roman democracy is a familiar story. Science, on the other hand, had two
            peaks, both in the Greek period and in no way associated with the shape of the
            Mediterranean basin or the relationship between core and peripheral areas. These two
            peaks are generally known as Ionian Science, from about 600 B.C. to about 400 B.C., and
            Hellenistic Science, from about 350 to 150 B.C. A link between the two was provided by

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Any Age of Expansion has strong trends toward rationalism because of
            the need to make
            decisions between alternative actions in a period when status is being disrupted and
            social atomism is prevalent because of expansion. Nevertheless, science (which is, of
            course, entirely different from rationalism because of its faith in observation) usually
            flourishes in an Age of Expansion and is killed off by irrationalism in the following
            Age of Conflict. In Classical antiquity this pattern was not followed. There,
            rationalism was very strong in the Age of Expansion and began to attack science while
            this period was still in progress. In the following period, science was destroyed, not
            by irrationalism, but by rationalism. The reason for this aberration in the pattern lies
            in the fact that in Classical antiquity rationalism became allied with oligarchy and
            shared in its victory over both science and democracy. The importance of this on
            subsequent intellectual history, especially our own, can hardly be overemphasized. It
            deserves a more detailed examination.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already said that reality is not completely rational because
            it consists of
            continua. Such continua are nonrational and nonlogical. They can be handled by various
            techniques all of which ultimately fall back on observation through the senses. Such
            continua can be dealt with simply by action; so that when a man runs or plays tennis we
            can say that he is dealing successfully with the continua of space and time. Such
            activity is based on the use of the senses (observation) plus unconscious (neurological)
            mental processes. These unconscious mental processes are, of course, nonrational
            (although not always \"irrational\") and nonlogical. Or, in the second case, we can deal
            with such continua rationally and logically by dividing them, as we did with the
            rainbow, by arbitrary and imaginary divisions into gamuts to which we attach rational
            labels. We then deal with these labels (or categories) by rational processes, but the
            verity of the conclusions reached by these processes must be checked through sensual
            observation. A third method of dealing with reality is by pure rationalism, but before
            we consider this we must say a few words about the Greek effort to use the second method
            to develop a scientific approach to reality.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is generally recognized that science, as we understand it, was
            born, but never
            fully developed, among the Greeks. It began to develop among the Ionians about 600 B.C.
            with the work of men like Thales of Miletus (ca. 624-547). About a century later the
            optimistic beliefs of the Ionian scientists began to be challenged by a number of
            thinkers who argued that reality was much more complex than was believed and that its
            nature varied with the point of view of the observer so that, for example, what seems
            warm to one observer seems cool to a different observer (or even to the same observer at
            a different time) so that we cannot say what is really warm or cool. The chief figure in
            this development of profound doubt was Heraclitus of Ephesus.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Heraclitus was obsessed with the dynamic qualities of observed
            reality, or, as we
            should put it, with the inabilityof man to deal with continua by any processes based on
            sensual observation. \"All is flux,\" he said. Or again, \"You cannot step into the same
            river twice.\" By this last statement he meant that the river is always changing. If we
            step into a river even a second after we stepped into it the first time, it is a
            different river. The first time we step into it, it is the
            river-we-have-not-yet-stepped-into, while the second time we step into it, it is the
            river-we-have-already-stepped-into. These are clearly different rivers, but they are
            different for other reasons as well. The second time, it is a different river because
            some of its water has flowed to the sea and been replaced by different water, the fish
            and plants in it have moved, and its bed and banks have worn away (however slightly).
            Obviously, it is not the same river. Although our senses can discern the changes only at
            the end of a long lime, it has changed somewhat in any time however brief. Similarly, it
            changes in space. We walk along its bank and say, \"Here is the river.\" But soon it is
            very narrow, and we say, \"Here is the brook.\" Yet nowhere can we find a spot or a line
            which separates the river from the brook or the brook from the rill. We say that John\'s
            body is renewed every seven years, its material being completely eliminated and replaced
            by new material. This process must go on constantly so that at the end of any time,
            however small, John is a different person. We thus have no right to expect debts to be
            paid, because we can never find the exact person to whom we made the loan, and anyone
            has the right to refuse to repay a loan on the ground that it was made to someone else.
            If we seek repayment after a long interval, say ten years, why should he not say: \"You
            have the wrong person. I do not have in my body a single molecule of the person to whom
            you made the loan ten years ago\"? Of course we might argue, in such a case, that the
            molecules might have changed but their configuration has remained the same, and the loan
            was made to the configuration, not to the sum total of molecules. The point of such a
            distinction between molecules and their configuration, somewhat like Aristotle\'s
            distinction between matter and its form, is that matter can be observed by the senses
            while the form has to be inferred by some mental process. According to these Greek
            nonscientific thinkers of the fifth century B.C., we can say nothing true or know
            nothing certain about the physical world of appearances. In this world \"all is flux.\"
            But behind this material world there must be some nonmaterial unchanging reality that
            can be found by rational thought. According to Heraclitus this reality behind
            appearances must be logos, a pattern of logical rationality.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;On the basis of arguments such as these there arose a school of
            rationalists following
            the teachings of Pythagoras (ca. 580-505 B.C.). To these Pythagorean rationalists the
            diversity and dynamics of the material world made it unknowable and outside the realm of
            possible discussion. But behind this \"appearance of things,\" which was really
            illusion,
            was reality. Such reality was rational and logical. Accordingly, reality could be found
            by reason and logic alone, without any appeal to the senses or to observation. In fact,
            such an appeal to observation would merely distract a person from the unchanging,
            knowable, unity of rational reality to the constantly changing, unknowable, illusion of
            appearances. This dichotomy between appearance and reality became basic in the outlook
            of the Pythagorean rationalists such as Pythagoras himself, Socrates, Plato, or the
            early Aristotle. They insisted that knowledge could be obtained not by approaching the
            material world through the senses but by turning away from the material world (which was
            unknowable illusion) to reality (which was rational and knowable). Reality was to be
            found by the use of reason and logic alone, because it was rational and logical. This
            involved the unstated assumption that man\'s rational and logical mental activities run
            parallel to reality and reflect it without any physical link between them. According to
            the Pythagorean rationalists the rational and logical reality behind the world of
            appearances and found by the use of reason and logic without observation was the
            eternal, rational, and unified field of mathematics. Our knowledge of these things was
            not based on observation but on \"reminiscence.\" Learning does not consist of putting
            anything into the mind but in recalling to the mind from its hiding place in the memory
            what the mind really knew all the while from some earlier existence or merely from its
            own structure. This process of remembering mathematics is demonstrated in Plato\'s Meno.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The best known case of an individual starting out as a follower of the
            Ionian sciences
            and then becoming a Pythagorean rationalist is to be found in the autobiographical
            remarks which Plato put into Socrates\' mouth in the Phaedo. In earlier years, he said,
            he had been a follower of the natural philosophers (that is, the scientists) and even
            for a while had accepted the teachings of Anaxagoras, but he soon discovered that the
            senses were not dependable and that the views of scientists were never in agreement and
            were always changing. Accordingly he had abandoned dependence on the body and discovered
            that truth could be found by reason alone. The real philosopher, he felt, should be glad
            to die, because this would free him from the confusion of the body and the senses. The
            knowledge of the essence of things must be sought \"with the mind alone, not introducing
            or intruding into the act of thought the sight or any other sense along with reason ...
            ; he who has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the whole
            body, these being in his opinion distracting elements which, when they infect the mind
            hinder it from acquiring truth and knowledge. . . .\" \"I decided,\" he said, \"to take
            refuge from the confusion of the senses in argument and by means of argument alone to
            determine the truth of reality.\" The truth thus revealed is recollection, recalled from
            a previous existence, and its truth is not to be tested, as a scientist would do, by
            observation but simply by the mathematical rule that all inferences deduced from it are
            mutually consistent.

            propagated by
            Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, and others were not tenable because long before, while
            Pythagoras was yet alive, one of his disciples had used the master\'s own Pythagorean
            theorem to prove that space was irrational (because it was a continuum). This means that
            it was possible to prove the irrationality of reality by purely rational (mathematical)
            arguments and that, accordingly, the fundamental assumption of this school about the
            rationality and logic of reality was false. Such a discovery should have led any honest
            seekers after truth to abandon this fundamental assumption about reality and to fall
            back on some other assumption (such as the scientists\' assumption that the senses do
            give us information about reality).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The continued adherence by the rationalist school to beliefs they knew
            were false can
            only be explained on the ground that they had an interest in these beliefs beyond their
            devotion to truth. Naturally this interest was not stated by these people publicly. At
            least, no such statement appears in the ancient evidence; so once again we must rely on
            inference: the key to the thinking of the Pythagorean rationalists lies in their fear of
            change and hatred of change. Beyond the ordinary change of the physical world they saw
            the social change that, for centuries, had been spreading political power and economic
            benefits wider and wider. There can be no doubt that the Pythagorean rationalists
            resented these political and social changes and wished to deny the possibility and
            reality of change. Pythagoras himself was the founder of an international oligarchic
            conspiracy, the Pythagorean Brotherhood, which operated out of Croton, in southern
            Italy, until it was forced to flee from that city by a democratic uprising about 510
            B.C. Thereafter this organization centered in Thebes in Boeotia. In international
            affairs it operated in support of the oligarchic states and in opposition to the
            democratic states, like Athens. In intellectual matters it attacked Ionian Science, the
            sophists, the philosophic nominalists, and the upholders of democracy and of human
            equality. The latter groups had become allied and, in some cases, identified for logical
            and historical reasons.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Until the end of the seventh century the Greeks lived in a fairly
            static society in
            which each individual\'s position was based on status rather than on choice or conscious
            decision and in which it was rare to meet any person with different customs or ideas
            than oneself. Accordingly, it was but natural for the Greeks to assume that the ideas
            and customs that they practiced themselves represented intrinsic and innate human nature
            and absolute truth in a system of absolute and universal values. The growth of commerce
            and of colonial expansion gave a rude shock to these ideas by showing the Greeks people
            with ideas and customs different from their own and often antithetical to theirs. The
            culmination of this educational process is to be seen in Herodotus, who is almost
            gullible in his readiness to believe that non-Greeks can practice almost any social
            customs. Experiences such as these could hardly fail to make a thoughtful people begin
            to examine the basis of their own customs. Can customs be based on essential human
            nature when different peoples act so differently? Or can there be any absolute value
            systems or social standards when different peoples have such diverse convictions? From
            these discussions there emerged, by the fifth century, two quite opposed points of view.
            On the one hand, the conservatives insisted that there was an absolute system of values
            and of social behavior and that in this system the customary Greek behavior was the
            natural inborn behavior of those beings who were fully human; any persons who acted or
            thought otherwise were at a lower level of this same absolute standard because their
            natures were not fully human. These conservatives saw the universe of living beings as a
            kind of hierarchy in which animals acted like animals, barbarians acted like barbarians,
            Greeks acted like men, and demigods acted like demigods, each according to its \"real\"
            nature. From this point of view developed two powerful theories that are still with us
            today: (!) that all differences between kinds of objects are real, eternal, and
            objective distinctions, and (2) that all differences between men are equally real,
            unchangeable, and objective, the result of biological (that is hereditary) differences.
            The first of these theories led, most obviously, to the corollary that species
            distinctions are real or, as the philosophers put it, universals are real. This is known
            as philosophic realism. The second, closely related theory, led to the belief that human
            personality is identical with human nature, each being based on the individual\'s
            biologic heredity and that, accordingly, social distinctions (such as those between
            noble and worker or between free man and slave) are based on real differences rooted in
            nature.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The point of view opposed to this absolute thinking was more
            relativist. It regarded
            differences in social customs as merely conventional differences indicating no real
            difference between barbarians and Greeks, between nobles and workers, or between free
            men and slaves. The external differences between these were merely accidental
            occurrences, resulting from different environment or upbringing, and signifying no
            really fundamental differences between the basic natures of the persons concerned. The
            customs of tribes or the positions of individuals were mere conventions, arising from
            history, and were thus capable of change in the future as they had changed in the past.
            In this point of view there was a distinction between nature and personality, the former
            being presumably the same for all men, while the latter was different merely because
            each person\'s history was different. Distinctions were not based on nature but on
            convention; moreover, if Heraclitus was correct about the dynamic nature of all the
            universe, then no distinctions between kinds of things were real, but were all equally
            conventional, drawn by a local consensus and indicated by verbal differences. This point
            of view led to philosophic nominalism and social, if not ethical, relativism. The chief
            distinction between noble and worker or between freeman and slave is not any absolute or
            real distinction but only a verbal distinction based, at most, on superficial and
            conventional distinctions such as exist between all individuals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;For reasons that should be evident, the absolute point of view based
            on philosophic
            realism had considerable appeal to the conservatives and the defenders of oligarchy. It
            denied the possibility of real change and justified the existing social and economic
            inequalities as being based on real, eternal distinctions. Furthermore, by insisting on
            the reality of group differences it reduced the appeal of individualism and justified
            the domination of the group over the individual.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Parallel reasons made the nominalist and relativist point of view
            appealing to the
            egalitarian, individualistic progressives. Nominalism, which recognized the existence of
            individuals, denied the real existence of groups and thus denied that economic and
            social inequalities were anything more than accidental and changeable features. This
            point of view justified individualism as the only reality, insisting that groups or
            universals were merely conventional collections of individuals to which a common name
            was given. Such a name was arbitrary and temporary, capable of change and even of
            complete reversal so that, for example, slavery could be called freedom and tyranny
            could be called justice, if men merely agreed on the convention to do so.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus the sophist Hippias, according to Plato, questioned the reality
            of the group (the
            state) by saying, \"I believe all of you are kinsmen, friends, and fellow citizens, not
            by law but by nature; for by nature like is akin to like but law is the tyrant of
            mankind and often makes us do many things which are against nature.\" And again the
            sophist Lycophron questioned class distinctions with the statement, \"The superiority of
            noble birth is imaginary, and its prerogatives are based merely upon a word.\" The real
            existence of a slavish nature in conventional slaves was challenged by thinkers like
            Alcidamas who said, \"God made all men free; no man is a slave by nature,\" and
            Euripides
            who wrote, \"The name alonebrings shame upon a slave, who can be excellent in every way
            and truly equal to the freeborn man.\" Another sophist, Antiphon, questioned the real
            distinction between Greek and non-Greek, saying, \"As to our natural gifts, we are all
            equal, whether we be Greeks or barbarians.\" According to Plato, Thrasymachus, a
            sophist,
            upheld the conventional, arbitrary, and nominalist character of justice by saying that
            this was merely a word which we apply to whatever the strong impose on the weak.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The nominalist outlook of the sophists was congenial and acceptable to
            the Ionian
            scientists, to the democrats, and to most progressive and reforming persons. In many
            instances, such as Anaxagoras, these \"popular\" roles were combined in one person. In
            any
            case, they were closely allied. This alliance, for a generation (461-429 B.C), was under
            the leadership and patronage of Pericles, in whose \"kitchen cabinet\" Anaxagoras was a
            prominent member.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The period of expansion continued until the middle of the third
            century B.C. in the
            western half of Classical antiquity, but ended two centuries earlier in the eastern
            half. We can fix these dates with a good deal of confidence, but the mechanism that
            caused the change is considerably clearer in one case than it is in the other. The
            dubious instance is the earlier one, in the mid-fifth century in the Greek-speaking
            world.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In this earlier case we can see quite clearly that there was a change
            from a period of
            expansion to a period of conflict. Before 450 B.C. the four usual kinds of expansion (in
            production, population, geographic extent, and knowledge) are evident, but after that
            date they are much less so. On the other hand, three of the four characteristics of an
            Age of Conflict (decreasing rate of economic expansion, increasing class conflicts,
            imperialist wars, irrationality) seem to be increasingly evident after 450 B.C. If we
            move further awayfrom this demarcation date, to compare, for example, 500 B.C. with 400
            B.C. or 550 B.C. with 350 B.C., it becomes even clearer that the culture has passed from
            expansion to conflict.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;To be sure there are difficulties, but in some cases, at least, these
            can be explained
            away. We must remember that the point at which a civilization (or an area in a
            civilization) turns from Stage 3 to Stage 4 is the point at which the rate of expansion
            ceases to rise and begins to decline; it is not the much later point at which expansion
            itself ceases and isreplaced by contraction. There is thus a considerable length of time
            between these two points during which expansion continues, but with a decreasing rate.
            In the case of a core area, such as Greece, the difficulty in determining the date is
            increased by the fact that the rate of expansion itself is still continuing to rise in
            more peripheral areas (such as the western Mediterranean), and the helpful influence of
            prosperity there can serve to conceal the less optimistic picture in the older area.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Other sources of ambiguity in demarking the two stages from each other
            arise from
            closely related conditions. The ending of geographic expansion and of the growth of
            knowledge is difficult to establish in the core of any civilizazation as long as that
            civilization is continuing to expand in its peripheral areas. In fact, the expression
            \"geographic expansion\" can apply only to the society as a whole and could never be
            established for some limited portion of it. On the other hand, it does seem likely,
            although the evidence is not available, that the growth of knowledge, for the ordinary
            Greek, ceased to increase in the fourth century. The wars, insecurity, and general
            confusion that became endemic in Greek life after 430 B.C. must have made it
            increasingly difficult for the ordinary Greek (that is, the one who lacked the leisure
            provided by slaveownership) to obtain information. The established methods by which
            information was diffused in Greek society, through conversation rather than by reading
            and thus through such periodic gatherings as the Olympic Games, the Panathenaic
            festival, and visits to the local agora, as well as the more irregular intercourse
            provided by visits from foreign celebrities or journeys to places like the Delphic
            oracle—all these weakened as methods of communication for the ordinary nonslaveowning
            Greek after 430 B.C. The possibility of becoming literate or of obtaining information
            from written works may also have decreased about this time, or a little later, for the
            nonslaveowner. On the other hand, these written sources of information may well have
            increased in availability for leisured slaveowners for a long time after the fifth
            century B.C.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If the cessation of the four aspects of an Age of Expansion is
            difficult to establish
            for Greece in the fifth century, the advent of at least three of the four aspects of an
            Age of Conflict is easy to demonstrate. There clearly was a decreasing rate of economic
            expansion, at least after 400 B.C., for the economic troubles of Greece in the fourth
            century and later are notorious. The growth of class conflicts seems equally evident. Of
            course, it might be argued that such class struggles were always present in Greece; and,
            within limits, that is true. Social tensions had reached a very high peak in the period
            of transition from gestation to full expansion but had then subsided only to rise again
            at the transition from expansion to conflict. In Athenian history where our historical
            evidence is more adequate than elsewhere, there can be no doubt that social tensions
            reached a high point in the period between Draco and Solon (say 600 B.C.) and then
            subsided to a low point about 500 B.C. (just before the Persian Wars) only to rise again
            about 400 B.C. Moreover, the kind of class conflict was different in the earlier period
            than it was in the later one. In the former the struggle was between the forces of
            dynamicism of the Age of Expansion and the efforts of the older dominant groups to
            prevent change and to maintain the static social conditions of the period of gestation.
            Draco and his supporters wished to maintain the noble-dominated, self-sufficient,
            largely pastoral economic units of the earlier period, and sought to resist the growth
            of such innovations as the expanding money economy, the growth of commerce, the
            development of city life, the rise of a middle class founded on commerce, the shift to a
            more democratic military force based on infantry from the older system based on the use
            of chariots by a hereditary nobility, and the resulting modifications of law and justice
            inevitable with increased social change. This kind of conflict was based on tensions of
            development in which older ways of providing for human needs resisted the innovation of
            new methods for providing for these needs. Such tension is endemic in any dynamic
            society, and, from it, social conflicts can arise at any time.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The increased social conflicts that arose after 450 B.C. were quite
            different, being
            caused by tensions of evolution rather than by tensions of development. They did not
            arise from resistance to change, and even less from unsuccessful resistance to change,
            but from growing desperation because expansion was slowing up.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Of even greater significance, perhaps, is the fact that in this newer
            evolutionary
            crisis the victory was falling more and more to the groups who hated change. This
            triumph of the reactionaries had occurred occasionally in the earlier period of acute
            developmental tensions, most notably in Sparta. There the legislation associated with
            the name of Lycurgus had stopped the development from an agrarian to a commercial
            economy and had retained local control of political and social life in the hands of the
            noble landlord class at the price of a renunciation of all commercial expansion. But
            this local reaction had been overcome in the Greek world as a whole by increased
            expansion elsewhere, as in Corinth or Athens. This is, of course, a clear case of
            geographic circumvention to a local reactionary triumph. But in the period after 400
            B.C. in the Greek world there was a general triumph of the forces of reaction. This can
            be seen in the victories of Sparta, Thebes, Macedonia, and Rome, all of whom supported
            the oligarchic groups over the democratic groups in each state they attacked.

            of the enemies of democracy such as Aristophanes, Xenophon, or Plato, but is most
            clearly shown in Thucydides. The latter describes the way in which each state became
            divided into two classes, the democratic group favorable to Athens and the oligarchic
            group favorable to Sparta. The bloody reprisals these two groups inflicted on each other
            provide some of the most violent pages in Greek history. In Corcyra, where this schism
            appeared in one of its earliest and most unhappy examples, the popular party obtained
            support from the rural slaves by offering them emancipation, while the oligarchic group
            hired mercenary fighters from neighboring areas, and each group set out, generally
            successfully, to massacre the other.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Closely related to these growing class conflicts was the increasing
            evidence of
            imperialist wars. In the earlier periods there had been political conflicts, but the
            economic expansion of each state, either intensively (as a shift from agriculture to
            commerce and handicrafts) or extensively (as colonial expansion), had usually taken
            place without headon collisions; but by 450 B.C. expansion was increasingly extensive
            rather than intensive and was more and more likely to seek political support for its
            extension because more than one group (each backed by its own state) was trying to
            expand into the same area, or into an area already occupied by a third group. These two
            modifications in the nature of expansion are characteristic of the shift from a period
            of expansion to a period of conflict. When an organization becomes institutionalized, it
            resists structural changes and thus decreases the amount of intensive expansion (which
            can be achieved only by structural changes) but still seeks to expand extensively by
            spreading its institutionalized structure over wider areas of exploitation. When
            numerous groups seek to do this, the limited number of such wider areas makes conflicts
            arise. Each group seeks to support its extensive expansion by political force, and the
            result is imperialist war. Indeed, one of the most notable characteristics of any Age of
            Conflict is the effort to achieve economic expansion by political rather than by
            economic means.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Here again Thucydides provides our most reliable evidence. The growing
            rivalry of
            diverse economic imperialisms is well shown in his writings, and culminated in the clash
            between Corinth and Athens in the Adriatic. Athens had come to dominate the commerce of
            the Aegean in the first half of the fifth century as Corinth dominated that of the
            Adriatic. When Athens tried to push into the Adriatic, allying with Corcyra to do so,
            Corinth called upon its ally, Sparta, and the fierce struggle began. It is clear that
            this Athenian effort to push a fairly primitive commercial economy into an area already
            occupied by a similar economy was unnecessary and was a result of the
            institutionalization of that system, but we do not know enough about the Greek economy
            of the day to say exactly how the system was institutionalized and how it could have
            been reformed.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We cannot ask of any economic system that it expand beyond the limits
            of its own
            technical knowledge or of its own social traits, but we have the right to expect that it
            utilize these before it seeks to expand by taking wealth from its neighbors. From this
            point of view it seems quite evident that Greek agriculture was far from exploiting its
            available resources when the imperialist wars began in the fifth century. At that time
            grain (usually barley) was grown in a two-field system in which the field was left
            fallow alternate years; this was equivalent to tilling only half the land each year. The
            fallow was left to recover the nutritive elements in the soil (nitrogen) and to a lesser
            extent the moisture. The latter could undoubtedly have been increased to some extent by
            irrigation, but a lack of private enterprise hampered this. As for the nutritive
            elements, these could have been increased sufficiently to reduce the fallowing to one
            year in three or even to eliminate it completely. The Greeks were fully aware of the
            nitrogen-providing qualities of leguminous crops: clover is mentioned in the Odyssey;
            and alfalfa came from Persia about 480 B.C.; other legumes were known, and their
            function as green manures was fully known to Xenophon and Theophrastus, yet were rarely
            used. The use of lime, marls, and various volcanic soils as inorganic fertilizers was
            also known, above all to Theophrastus. Yet these improvements were generally neglected.
            The causes of this neglect are to be attributed to a general lack of enterprise
            associated with a long-established slave system and the growing idea that agricultural
            labor was a menial activity beneath the dignity of free men. A wider use of legumes and
            of irrigation could have been made the basis for a more intensive use of livestock and
            this, in turn, could have led to a considerable increase in the use of meat and cheese
            in the Greek diet. But, as long as so much of agricultural labor was slaves, and these
            could be fed on barley and fish, there was little incentive to seek improvements in
            diet. To some extent such improvements in living were hampered by poor transportation,
            especially by inadequate harnessing that made it hardly worthwhile to use draft animals,
            so that heavy work had to be done by slaves. Here again the existence of slavery
            undoubtedly discouraged innovation: the slaves had to be fed 365 days in the year and
            had to be kept busy, so there was no real profit in any inventions that would reduce the
            work of slaves, since their field work in agriculture kept them busy only a small part
            of the year. Fields were plowed four or five times in a year, and each time were plowed
            over and over again in many directions \"until it was no longer possible to see in which
            direction the plow went last.\" The clods were broken up with mattocks. Although this
            used enormous labor, it was recognized that any increase in efficiency would merely have
            served to increase the periods in which the slaves were idle. It was difficult to turn
            slaves to other activities such as vine dressing or olive trimming because these
            required too much skill for ordinary slaves. In a similar way, deep plowing and drill
            planting of seed were known to produce superior crops but were not used for lack of
            enterprise.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;On none of these matters can we be very certain of our
            interpretations, because the
            facts are rather scanty, but it does seem that the Greek economic system, especially in
            agriculture, ceased to improve after 400 B.C. even though the knowledge that could have
            made improvements possible was available. Undoubtedly this had a considerable influence
            on the growth of imperialist wars, and seems to indicate that slavery had become an
            institution.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The fourth aspect of any Age of Conflict, increase in irrationality,
            is lacking in the
            Greek world after 450 B.C. and was generally rare in Classical antiquity, even when this
            society was clearly deep in its Age of Conflict. One reason probably lies in the general
            tendency toward rationality that existed among the Greeks and that we have tried to
            attribute to their Indo-European heritage. Of even greater significance was the
            alliance, already mentioned, between rationalism and the triumphant oligarchy.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The critics and enemies of democracy and of the whole Athenian way of
            life with its
            emphasis on change, commerce, and social equality formed a motley bloc made up of the
            philosophic realists, the conservatives and rationalists, especially the Pythagoreans,
            the defenders of nobility, of oligarchy, and of the state\'s authority, the admirers of
            Sparta, and the enemies of science. These groups were broken and disorganized for almost
            a century after the revolt at Croton (510 B.C.), and were kept off balance by the long
            series of political and economic successes of the Athenian democracy, but when these
            successes were followed by a longer series of disasters after 431 B.C., the oligarchic
            bloc began to organize. It is extremely likely that the nucleus of this revived
            oligarchic movement came from the Pythagorean refugees in Thebes. In any case, it
            brought together the diverse groups we have mentioned. The greatest figure in this group
            was Plato, who, like Anaxagoras a century earlier in the opposing bloc, combined many
            diverse trends. The writings of Plato remain as the most successful statement of the
            oligarchic rationalist position, although it is frequently stated even more explicitly
            elsewhere, as in some of the early works of Aristotle (when he was still a Platonic
            rationalist), especially the first book of the Politics.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The rivalry between these two blocs appeared repeatedly in the public
            controversies of
            Athens during the century 450-350 B.C. and even later. The condemnation of Anaxagoras
            about 450 B.C. was as much an event in this struggle as was the trial and conviction of
            Pericles in 430 B.C. So also was the execution of Socrates (399 B.C.) and Plato\'s
            reaction to this deed by founding the Academy on endowments that continued for 914 years
            (385 B.C.-A.D. 529).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There were three basic ideas of this oligarchic group: (1) that change
            was evil,
            superficial, illusory, and fundamentally impossible; (2) that all material things were
            misleading, illusory, distracting, and not worth seeking; and (3) that all rationally
            demonstrable distinctions, including those in social position (especially slavery), were
            based on real unchanging differences and not upon accidental or conventional
            distinctions. These three ideas together would serve to stop all efforts at social
            change, economic reform, or political equality
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These ideas, which we might sum up under some such comprehensive term
            as Pythagorean
            rationalism, were, of course, not irrational, yet they led, ultimately, to mysticism and
            served the same purpose of providing an ideology for the vested-interest groups that
            irrational thinking usually does in the Age of Conflict of any civilization. In the Age
            of Conflict of Classical antiquity these ideas generally triumphed, although they were
            challenged, generally with little effect, by the later Aristotle (after 343 B.C.), by
            Epicurus and Lucretius, and by numerous minor thinkers in the late Hellenistic and Roman
            periods. When, in the latter period, some of the sophist ideas, such as the conventional
            nature of slavery, became widely accepted, they were combined, as in Stoicism, with
            resignation and acceptance of the external appearances of things to a degree that
            entirely cancelled the dynamic and progressive influence they had possessed when
            advocated by the Sophists.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It might be pointed out at this time that the triumph of the
            vested-interest groups
            (the oligarchy) in the struggles of the Age of Conflict of Classical civilization
            resulted in the social, political, and economic triumph of the oligarchy over the
            progressive and revolutionary forces. This led to the survival of the works of the
            intellectual supporters of oligarchy, such as Plato, Xenophon, and Cicero, and to the
            loss of most of the works of the opposite side, such as the writings of the Sophists and
            Ionian scientists; the rich were willing to pay for making copies of works favoring
            their position and would not pay for copying of opposition works. Thus we have today the
            writings of Pindar and Xenophon, but have lost those of Anaxagoras and Epicurus.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Moreover, it should be pointed out that the oligarchic victory over
            the forces of
            progress and equality did not ensure survival to the victors in the long run, or the
            ending of the opposition\'s ideology. Quite the contrary. The military tyranny that
            arose
            as a consequence of the oligarchy\'s efforts to maintain slavery and social inequality
            by
            force eventually took over the control of Classical society in its own name and
            liquidated the oligarchy and the Classical culture it had maintained. In a similar way
            the ideological writings of the supporters of oligarchy survived, but many of the ideas
            of their nominalist opponents became generally accepted. Thus individualism, the natural
            equality of all men, the conventional and unnatural character of slavery, and the belief
            that social distinctions rested on force rather than on real differences became
            generally accepted in the Stage of Universal Empire, but without in any way destroying
            the continued existence as institutions of slavery, social inequality, law, or public
            authority. Of course, in the very long run, with the disappearance of these institutions
            it might be argued that the ideas that challenged them won out, but this occurred only
            with the death of Classical society as a whole.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It would seem then that the period after 450 B.C. (in the eastern
            Mediterranean at
            least) had the chief, if not all, features of an Age of Conflict. Similarly, the
            following period in the eastern Mediterranean had many of the features of an Age of
            Universal Empire. These latter features continued from the establishment of Macedonian
            supremacy in the seventh decade of the fourth century until the disruption of
            Alexander\'s empire and the growing power of Rome threw the eastern Mediterranean back
            into the belated Age of Conflict still continuing in the western Mediterranean (until
            146 B.C.).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The imperialist wars of the eastern Mediterranean\'s local Age of
            Conflict continued
            almost without interruption from the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 B.C. to
            the conquests of Alexander the Great a century later. Chief events in this period were
            the Spartan triumph over Athens in 404 B.C., the Theban victory over Sparta in 371 B.C.,
            and the Macedonian conquest of all Greece at Chaeronea in 338 B.C. The conquests of
            Alexander the Great during the following fifteen years established a \"core\" or
            preliminary universal empire and some of the features of this fifth stage in the
            evolution of civilization continued, in spite of the subsequent breakup of that empire
            among the Diadochi. The chief of these features was the creation of a far-flung
            commercial unity that encouraged distant trade and geographic division of labor. In a
            full universal empire, such as existed in the Roman Empire under the Antonines, this
            would have been carried on to include a single monetary system, a unified legal system,
            and other aspects of unified rule and would have given rise to a period of peace and
            prosperity to which we apply the term \"golden age.\" In Alexander\'s system this golden
            age was never reached because the core empire was disrupted and its temporary beneficial
            effects were obliterated by the intrusion into the eastern Mediterranean of the Age of
            Conflict still going on in the western Mediterranean.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Age of Expansion in the western Mediterranean lasted from the
            seventh century to
            the middle of the third century, and thus continued for two hundred years after
            expansion had begun to decline in the east. It was, on the whole, somewhat different
            from the earlier expansion in the east, being more agricultural than commercial and more
            dependent on slavery. Moreover, nonindigenous peoples like the Etruscans and the
            Carthaginians made very considerable contributions to it. From the Etruscans, for
            example, came valuable contributions in regard to irrigation and drainage, while the
            Carthaginians developed the use of plantation slavery, especially in Sicily. Plantation
            slavery, which refers to the use of gangs of slaves on large estates, was always rare in
            Greece but became in the west the admired form of agrarian organization. It also became
            the mechanism by which the slave system was changed from an instrument of expansion to
            an institution of conflict.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the earlier period, when agrarian units were still small they were
            worked by
            citizen-soldiers, frequently helped by slaves. Hesiod in Greece (about 700 B.C.) and
            Cincinnatus in Italy would be examples of such farmers. The story of how Cincinnatus was
            summoned from his plow to be dictator of Rome when it was attacked by the Aequi in 458
            B.C. and how he returned to his work after a victorious sixteen-day campaign is
            significant on two counts. It shows the amateur and temporary status of Roman soldiers
            at this early period, and it shows that an important citizen worked in the fields
            himself.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;By 200 B.C. the citizen-soldier and the family-size farm were both
            beginning to vanish
            from Italy. The ravages of Hannibal in his invasion of Italy during the Second Punic War
            (218-201 B.C.) had destroyed buildings, equipment, and livestock beyond the ability of
            the ordinary peasant to replace them. Moreover, these peasants had been away from their
            farms for years and had difficulty returning to the onerous routine of peasant life. The
            overseas conquests resulting from the war required a permanent standing army. This was
            recruited from the uprooted peasants of Italy. The farms of these displaced peasants
            were purchased by war profiteers or larger landlords who had made money from war
            contracts or war booty and were in a position to buy the ravaged Italian farms, combine
            them into large estates, and equip them with buildings and livestock from their wartime
            profits. The captives taken in the war provided slaves with which these new estates
            could be worked.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process was encouraged by a number of other factors. In Sicily,
            which had been
            annexed from Carthage in 240, and in Africa, which was acquired forty years later, the
            Romans found a functioning agrarian system based on large estates. These were copied in
            Italy and, later, in Spain in accordance with the methods of the Carthaginian
            agricultural writer Mago, whose works were translated into Latin in the second century
            B.C. The Roman government was unable to pay off the debts incurred during the Second
            Punic War except by alienating public lands to the speculators and profiteers who were
            the chief creditors. Other public lands were transformed into latifundia by tenancy or
            by simple usurpation. Once Sicily and Africa were acquired, Italy found it difficult to
            compete with these new territories in raising grain. Accordingly, the farm lands of
            Italy were shifted from grain to the production of olive oil, wool, and wine. Grain
            could be raised on both large and small farms and by persons who had large or small
            amounts of capital. Olives and wool could be raised only on large holdings and only by
            persons with considerable capital. Thus the shift from family farms to great estates was
            encouraged in Italy by the shift from grain to olives and wool.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;One last but important factor in this change to large estates was the
            fact that
            landownership carried an appearance of aristocracy and social prestige, since the
            nobility were by law excluded from commerce, and restricted their economic activities to
            agriculture. As a result, every parvenu who made money in commerce, industry,
            speculation, or war contracts sought to win public sanction of his rise in the social
            scale by acquiring a large estate—the larger, the better. In this way many persons with
            no direct knowledge or interest in farming became owners of latifundia worked by slaves
            in charge of a steward. In consequence there grew up a pattern of ostentatious display
            of landed luxury, great debts, and separation of management from ownership.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This new pattern of agrarian organization created a demand for slaves
            that could
            hardly be satisfied. No slave system has ever been able to continue to function on the
            slaves provided by its own biological reproduction because the rate of human
            reproduction is too slow and the expense from infant mortality and years of unproductive
            upkeep of the young make this prohibitively expensive. This relationship is one of the
            basic causes of the American Civil War, and was even more significant in destroying
            ancient Rome. The normal method for supplying the slave needs of Classical antiquity was
            by sales of war captives. But even this was not sufficient to meet the demand. It was,
            however, sufficient to make war an endemic element in Roman life. The supply of slaves
            had to be supplemented by other means. The senate, which was the chief organ of
            government and in control of the landed rather than of the commercial classes, permitted
            piracy to flourish in the Mediterranean because it supplied captives to the slave marts.
            This continued until the middle of the first century B.C. when the revolutionary threat
            from the discontented to break up the latifundia forced the owners of these estates to
            seek support from the commercial groups by wiping out piracy that preyed on commerce.
            The ease with which piracy was suppressed by Pompey in 67 B.C. is evidence of the lack
            of effort made in this task earlier.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The supply of slaves was also increased by systematic plundering of
            the Roman
            provinces and the territories of states. Cicero tells us that each provincial governor
            had to return after his brief rule with three fortunes peculated from the province: one
            went to pay the bribes that had obtained his appointment, a second went to obtain
            acquittal from the charges brought against him on his return, and the third was for
            himself. A similar behavior was found among lesser provincial officials, especially the
            tax collectors, who often left an area ruined and depopulated.

            104 B.C. Marius
            called upon the allied King Nicomedes of Bithynia to provide auxiliary troops for
            services against the Cimbri. The king replied that he was unable to do so because of the
            depopulation of his country by the slave raiding of Roman officials. When this message
            reached Rome, the senate ordered that enslaved freeborn citizens of Roman allies who
            were being held in Roman provinces should be freed, but after eight hundred were freed
            in Sicily within a few days, the landlords were able to exercise sufficient political
            pressure to stop execution of the decree.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a consequence of such methods the number of slaves increased
            greatly in the period
            of the late republic, and the danger of slave revolts increased accordingly. William L.
            Westermann and Tenney Frank agree that at least 250,000 war captives were enslaved in
            the first fifty years of the second century B.C. Livy tells us that 70,000 slaves
            participated in the Sicilian slave revolt of 135 B.C.; 20,000 were armed by the rebels
            in the Social War in 90 B.C.; while Spartacus, who refused help from many, led 120,000
            against the city in 72 B.C. In 37 B.C. Octavius Caesar trained 20,000 slaves obtained
            from his supporters to be oarsmen in his struggle with Sextus Pompeius, and, after his
            victory, he restored to their owners 30,000 slaves who had been serving with his
            defeated opponent.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This great increase in the number of slaves after 250 B.C. did not
            reflect any
            increase in their productive use. On the contrary, all the evidence indicates that
            larger and larger numbers were used in quite nonproductive activities: attending their
            masters, lolling about urban residences, or carrying letters and packages. Moreover,
            between Cato (who wrote his De Agri Cultura about 160 B.C.) and Varro (who wrote his
            Rerum Rusticarum about 37 B.C.) there was a definite shift from a rigorous profit
            motivation to a more humane and leisurely attitude toward slaves.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Even on the land itself there was a decrease in efficiency. The shift
            of managerial
            decisions from an owner on the spot who had a personal interest in efficiency to a
            freeman overseer who had no such interest does much to explain the mechanism by which
            the slave-based agricultural system changed from instrument to institution. The owner,
            of course, had a personal concern in increase of output because each increase accrued to
            him. But an overseer had an interest in a stable output year by year, something quite
            different.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If an agricultural unit is operated at peak human efficiency, its
            output will
            fluctuate from year to year by a considerable amount, depending on climate conditions.
            In such a case the overseer of an absentee landlord would have obtained only a modicum
            of praise in good years (since the high output was attributed to the weather), but would
            get a maximum of blame in poor years (on the argument that he should have been able to
            anticipate or compensate for adverse weather conditions). Under such fluctuations the
            overseer would have a precarious tenure and would frequently have been discharged.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;On the other hand, if the farm had a fairly consistent output year
            after year within
            narrow limits of fluctuation, the owner would have secured an annual income on which he
            could depend and the overseer would have a relatively secure tenure. For this reason
            there was a general tendency for each agricultural unit to approach a fixed annual
            output. Such a steady output could be obtained only by stabilizing around the output of
            the poorer years, since it could not be done around the output of the better years. This
            means that the overseer drove his slaves hard if a year\'s output seemed likely to fall
            below his preset annual output figure, but relaxed discipline whenever it became clear
            that the year\'s output was likely to exceed the same preset annual output goal. The
            amount of output lost in the latter years (the meteorologically better ones) was always
            more than the amount of output gained by driving hard in the years when output would be
            naturally lower, since the preset annual figure was closer to the lower-output years
            than to the higher-output years of the farm under efficient management. The net result
            of all this was a reduction and stabilization of output on large estates of absentee
            owners. As the number of such estates increased, the output of the whole economy
            suffered.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This reduction of output for the system as a whole probably did not
            occur until after
            the time of Augustus or even later, and was concealed for a long time by the fact that
            the Roman political system was expanding geographically over larger and larger areas and
            thus obtaining control of larger and larger absolute amounts of agricultural produce
            even when the economic system as a whole was not producing more each year but less.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is, however, very likely that the Mediterranean economic system as
            a whole reached
            its highest rate of expansion before 300 B.C. and was operating at a decreasing rate of
            expansion by 250 B.C. From 200 B.C. to A.D. 200 its absolute output increased only
            slightly, and by the latter date economic decline in absolute output had begun.
            Accordingly, the Age of Conflict for the western Mediterranean began by 250 B.C. and the

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Universal Empire of Classical civilization was achieved with the
            establishment of
            the political supremacy of Rome throughout the Mediterranean in 146 B.C. The rise of
            Rome had little to do with the Age of Expansion. Rome began as an Etruscan bridgehead on
            the south bank of the Tiber at a place where several hills on that bank made it possible
            to defend a ford that crossed the river by way of an island. Thus from its earliest
            origin the Roman organization was militarized. Its political expansion, coinciding with
            the decline of the Etruscans, was dominated by military considerations. By 250 B.C.,
            when the shift from an Age of Expansion to an Age of Conflict gave an increased role to
            any militarized system, Rome was ready to play that role. Until that moment the usual
            features of an Age of Expansion were obvious: increased production, increased
            population, increased geographic area for Classical culture as a whole, and increased
            knowledge. Of the lesser attributes of this period, democracy is manifest, although
            science is less so.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;After 250 B.C. the attributes of an Age of Conflict became clear:
            class conflict,
            imperialist wars, irrationality, and declining democracy. All these acted and reacted on
            the agrarian slave system, increasing the number of slaves and the size of estates. This
            monopolization of the land led to a depopulation of the Italian countryside. Many
            peasants decided that they could live on the dole in Rome easier than they could win a
            living from the soil. As Seneca wrote about A.D. 50, \"Country districts which were once
            the plowlands of whole villages are now worked by a single band of slaves, and the power
            of stewards is wider than the realms of kings.\" He also wrote, \"Great troops of slaves
            whom their owner does not know by sight and the slave prisons echoing to the sound of
            the lash have no attraction for me.\" Elsewhere the situation was even worse. Pliny
            tells
            us that in the time of Nero (A.D. 54-68), six men held half the province of Africa.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Conditions became worse after 50 B.C. when Italy\'s industry, which
            had previously
            produced metal products and tasteless pottery for export, was unable to compete
            successfully with the industrial activity of the provinces, especially Gaul. One cause
            of this may be found in the fact that the craftsmen of Italy were mostly slaves, while
            those of Gaul were largely free. As a result of this, commerce, which had been
            flourishing under the republic, began to decrease under the empire, the imperial trade
            being replaced to a considerable extent by local and provincial commerce, except for the
            trade in luxury goods and in grain. The latter continued to pour into Italy from the
            provinces, especially from Egypt, which was also the source of papyrus. Under the
            republic Italy still paid for these imports by metal goods, red-ware pottery, and other
            products, but under the empire Italian exports decreased in importance, and imports had
            to be paid for in gold or silver. This began a steady flow of precious metals from
            Italy, especially from Rome to the provinces. These metals had to be brought back by new
            conquests extending the frontiers and by ransacking of the provinces by the provincial
            governors and armies. Thus the army, the imperialist wars, and the corruption in
            provincial government were necessary for the economic survival of the Roman system.
            Plunder kept the system functioning until the military weakening of Rome made it
            impossible to extend the frontiers further, and neither the supply of slaves nor the
            restoration of specie could be maintained. Thus, by 146 B.C. the Roman state had become
            the Universal Empire of Classical civilization, although it required another century and
            a half before class conflicts and imperialist wars were reduced in frequency. The class
            conflicts led to the so-called civil wars that ended with the triumph of Augustus Caesar
            in 31 B.C. The imperialist wars continued as Roman attacks on outside peoples, and led
            to the conquest of Gaul, of Egypt, and of Britain.

            its golden age,
            a subperiod that continued for about three generations (96-180) under the \"Five Good
            Emperors.\" Of this period Gibbon wrote, \"If a man were called to fix the period in the
            history of the world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and
            prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from the death of
            Domitian to the accession of Commodus.\" But, as Gibbon knew well, it needed but a
            slight
            change for this golden prosperity to become the brown of overripeness and decay.

            With the end of
            continual warfare and the clear inability of Rome\'s military forces to extend its
            frontiers further, the supply of both slaves and booty ceased. The unfavorable balance
            of payments of Italy became more acute. Trade began to decrease sharply, and a tendency
            for each province, even each large estate, to move toward economic self-sufficiency
            began. There was a return to grain growing in Italy. Craft activities began to move from
            the towns to the estates. The towns themselves ceased to grow, and later declined. The
            decreasing supply of slaves and the exodus of free persons from the town to the
            countryside gradually brought about an agrarian reorganization in which the landlords
            began to work their estates with tenants, requiring payment in kind and labor services
            on their own holdings as part of the rent. These tenants were called coloni.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Efforts to overcome the chronic economic depression by government
            action led to a much
            enlarged governmental bureaucracy and to an increased tax burden. This fell primarily on
            the landlords because of the dwindling commercial and craft activities, because the army
            was no longer paying its way from the booty of war but remained an expensive financial
            burden, and because landed wealth was something the tax collector could lay his hands
            on. The scarcity of manpower and the efforts of tenants to move from one landlord to
            another seeking better terms gave the landlords an excuse for refusing to pay taxes. To
            obviate such excuses, laws were passed forbidding the coloni to move from their
            tenancies, making these hereditary, and making the landlord responsible for his
            tenants\'
            taxes since he could be found by the tax collector more easily than they could and his
            lands would be surety for payment. Thus the coloni tended to become serfs. In time they
            tended to look to the landlord for protection and for settlement of their disputes. At
            the same time, as the government became weaker and more remote, the free villagers, or
            vici, also began to look toward powerful local landlords for these same services of
            protection and justice. The government passed laws to prevent this growing system of
            patronage but without stopping it.

            investment, as we
            have seen, had declined earlier and more rapidly. The vital issue was no longer
            expansion but survival. The political disorders of the third century can be measured by
            one fact: in sixteen years forty six emperors or would-be emperors met death by
            violence. Such disorders, intensified in the fourth and following centuries by the
            barbarian migrations, led to a flight from the towns to the country. Everyone wanted an
            established relationship to the food-producing land. As all municipal life decreased in
            vigor, agrarian units increased in self-sufficiency.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The shift of real power from the senate to the armies began as early
            as 100 B.C., but
            was not legally recognized until A.D. 195 when, for the first time, an emperor ruled
            without any senatorial election. Control of the imperial position became a clear power
            struggle between army commanders. Because such commanders could no longer retain the
            loyalty of their forces by periodic distribution of provincial booty and foreign slaves,
            they rewarded them from the chief remaining source of wealth, the landed holdings of
            their political opponents. This gradual liquidation of the landed class and their
            replacement by army leaders sprung from the more remote and backward areas of the empire
            entirely destroyed the town-dwelling landed elite who had been the carriers of the
            Classical culture. As this aristocratic, clarid, urban, moderate, mundane culture was
            destroyed, it was replaced by a welter of unprincipled violence, grasping materialism,
            crass ignorance, crude illiteracy, and narrow, rural provincialism. In reaction against
            this, there eventually arose a new spiritualism and asceticism, a flight from
            worldliness, mingled with all kinds of new religious feelings and dark superstitions but
            also containing much exalted spirituality. Both of these movements were fatal to the
            Classical ideology. In fact, it became increasingly difficult to find anyone with
            allegiance to the Classical idea, and certainly no one was willing to sacrifice or die
            for it. Yet without its ideology no culture can survive.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a matter of fact, Rome had increasing difficulty defending these
            long-established
            frontiers themselves. This difficulty arose from a number of factors. Rome itself was
            getting weaker. Its ideology was losing allegiance everywhere; morale was evaporating;
            the economic system was declining; the political system was finding it increasingly
            difficult to get its orders obeyed; the social system was disintegrating. Even the army
            was becoming completely institutionalized, consisting largely of permanent garrisons,
            recruited from barbarians, with only local interests, and surely no interest in seeking
            death for the Classical idea or even for the Roman state. At the same time military
            problems were changing. Originally Roman infantry was pushing into barbarian territory.
            Later barbarian horsemen were raiding into imperial territory. Ultimately whole
            barbarian tribes were migrating into the empire itself. The inability of the famous
            Roman Legion to withstand charging horsemen made Rome indefensible. Rome had not had to
            face this problem earlier because adequate rain on the Northern Grasslands, century
            after century, reduced the tendency for barbarians to move. But decreased rainfall after
            A.D. 200 created a pressure of moving pastoral peoples that became irresistible. The
            final blow here was the pressure of the Huns out of the Asiatic steppes and on to the
            horse-riding Germans along the Roman Danubian frontier. The Gothic victory over the
            Roman army at Adrianople in 378 showed clearly that the final crisis had been reached.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;What could be done? The situation both of the Roman state and of
            Classical culture was
            hopeless unless the defensive forces could be shifted quickly from infantry to cavalry.
            This was impossible, not only for the lack of experience in the techniques of cavalry
            warfare but equally because the weakened Classical economic system could not support a
            large number of horses. Horses, as grain-eating animals, compete for food directly with
            men. The inefficiency of the Classical Mediterranean economy, based on an
            institutionalized slave system, could not produce such a surplus. Yet without cavalry
            the society could not resist the intruding barbarians.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In fact, the crisis was more fundamental than the simple fact of
            military defense. No
            one any longer had faith in the Classical ideology or in the Classical gods. A new
            ideology and a new religion were needed. Though they were already at hand in
            Christianity, they could not be fitted into the Classical culture with which they were
            fundamentally incompatible.

            good job because any additional output arising from increased care would accrue to
            themselves. But such a technology was much better adapted to the well-watered, heavy

            watered light soils of the wintergrowing Mediterranean.

            armed with impact
            weapons, and equipped with strong horses, stirrups, and horeshoes, this technique was
            extremely expensive (in terms of grain consumption) so that one fighting man had to be
            supported by a hundred or more tillers of the soil. Here again, the areas north of the
            Alps, with their more productive grain fields and more adequate grasslands, were far
            better able to support the new system than was the older Mediterranean area.

            When these came together north of the Alps, in the peripheral zone of Classical society,
            there appeared the core area of a new Western culture. But at the same time, in the old
            core area of Classical society, in the Aegean, sufficiently profound changes occurred in
            Classical culture to permit a variant ofit to survive for another thousand years. This
            gives rise to one of the greatest puzzles of analytic history: Was Byzantine culture a
            new society or was it merely a revived Classical culture? Or is it possible that
            Byzantine culture is an earlier phase of Orthodox (Russian) civilization? In view of the
            fact that Byzantine culture had a different religion, ideology, social organization,
            military and economic technology, and almost certainly a different organization of
            expansion, it seems difficult to regard it as simply a reformed Classical culture. Its
            relative continuity in politics and law is not that significant. On the other hand, it
            hardly seems feasible to regard Byzantium as a wholly new civilization. Its brief life
            of about a thousand years would make it a rival with Hittite society for the position of
            the shortest-lived of all civilizations. Whatever decision is made in this difficult
            problem is bound to be unsatisfactory from many points of view, just as a mass of quartz
            at the junction of two or more crystals cannot be attributed to one or another with any

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the fissure in the West between Classical culture
            and Western
            civilization is quite clear. The death of one society and the birth of an entirely new
            civilization in the peripheral area of a previous one is quite definite. On every level
            of culture, from the most material technology on one extreme to the most abstract
            ideology or religion on the other extreme, these two civilizations are different.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The death of Classical civilization and the barbarian migrations that
            accompanied it
            left the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and an extensive hinterland behind them in
            cultural chaos. The area was filled with shattered social groups and cultural wreckage
            bobbing about on swirls and eddies as if a great ship had sunk in a quiet sea. In the
            next three hundred years (500-800) these peoples and cultural debris began to integrate
            to form core areas of three new civilizations. All of these were on the extreme
            periphery of the older Classical society. To the southeast, in Arabia, appeared Islamic
            civilization; to the northeast, in the Northern Flatlands, appeared Orthodox Russian
            civilization; and in the northwest, in France, appeared Western civilization. Each of
            these had its distinctive outlook and organization, as all societies do, and the
            relationship between the three became one of the continuing problems of the next fifteen
            hundred years.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Western civilization presents one of the most difficult tasks for
            historical analysis,
            because it is not yet finished, because we are a part of it and lack perspective, and
            because it presents considerable variation from our pattern of historical change. The
            first two of these difficulties are obvious enough. If Western civilization is still in
            its course, its future is not yet settled and its past is, accordingly, capable of
            diverse interpretations. Moreover, our own involvement in it handicaps our
            interpretation because many of its most significant features are so familiar to us that
            we accept them without statement or even recognition. The importance of these two
            difficulties will appear in our own analysis.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Moreover, the analysis of Western civilization in terms of the seven
            stages is
            difficult because it clearly does not follow the straightforward pattern of seven simple
            stages. Of course, any student in any society has an inclination to regard his own
            culture as being in some way exceptional, but in this case, more than others, there
            seems to be objective justification for such a feeling. No culture has ever exceeded
            Western civilization in power and extent. Our society now covers more than half of the
            globe, extending in space from Poland in the east to Australia in the west. In the
            course of this expansion, most of it during the last five centuries, the power of
            Western civilization has been so great that it has destroyed, almost without thinking of
            it, hundreds of other societies, including five or six other civilizations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As we have already indicated, the history of Western civilization to
            the middle of the
            twentieth century is not a simple story of rise and fall, but rather a series of at
            least three successive pulsating movements of expansion. Each period of expansion has
            been followed by an Age of Crisis, but in two, and probably in all three, of these
            crises the organization of expansion has been circumvented or reformed sufficiently to
            provide a new instrument of expansion and accordingly a new period in Stage 3. We have
            already given these three periods of expansion the rough dates 970-1270, 1420-1650, and
            1730-1929. Each of these ended in an Age of Conflict.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Any such analysis as this is bound to lead to disagreement among
            students of the
            subject and, as a consequence, it may be necessary to give in this chapter some
            references to scholarly research, something we have managed to avoid in the earlier
            chapters of this book.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Although Western civilization emerged from the wreckage of Classical
            antiquity, it
            differed from it in every important aspect of its culture. Even in its first three
            stages it had a different military system (based on specialized cavalry rather than on
            infantry), a different technology (based on animal power rather than on slavery), a
            different economic organization, a different political organization (formed about rural
            castles rather than around municipal acropolises), and, above all, an entirely different
            religious system and basic ideology. The only level where a certain similarity between
            the two cultures could be found is on the social levels where both civilizations began
            with a two class society of fighting nobles and agricultural peasantry organized in
            self-sufficient economic units (genos and manor) and slowly changed, in both cases, by
            the insertion of a town-dwelling commercial middle class between the original two. We
            have already spoken of this similarity.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The differences between the two societies on most levels of culture
            are either well
            known or will be explained in the present chapter. But the most important difference,
            that on the intellectual level, is too significant to be discussed in this cursory way.
            In any society the nonmaterial culture is the most significant feature of the whole
            society, because it is the least capable of being exported and because it is pervasive
            in all the other levels as well. In this particular case there is the additional
            necessity for exposition of this aspect, because of widespread ignorance or
            misunderstanding of it.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might begin by saying that Western ideology is optimistic,
            moderate, hierarchical,
            democratic, individualistic yet social, and dynamic. All these terms refer only to
            aspects of the whole and do not really get us to its essence. This essence might be
            summed up in the belief that \"Truth unfolds in time through a communal process.\"
            Before
            we attempt to analyze this rather cryptic statement, we should say a few words about the
            more superficial aspects.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Western outlook is optimistic because it believes that the world
            is basically good
            and that the greatest good lies in the future. This covers all the ideas Etienne Gilson
            included in the term \"Christian optimism.\" The Classical ideology began by being
            mundane
            and ended with a dualism in which it saw the universe as an evil material world opposed
            to a good spiritual sphere. Western ideology believes that the material is good and the
            spiritual is better but that they are not opposed to each other since the material world
            is necessary for the achievement of the spiritual world. The world and the flesh are
            good because they were both made by God (as in the Old Testament). The material world is
            necessary to the spiritual in two ways: (1) no soul exists without a body and (2) no
            soul can be saved except by its own efforts and cooperative actions with other persons,
            both of which can be achieved only by bodily actions in this world. These ideas appeared
            clearly in the Christian religion, although they had a very difficult time getting
            accepted because the dualistic late Classical ideology regarded the world and the flesh
            as evil and felt that the spirit could achieve full spirituality only by freeing itself
            from the body, from the world, and from contact with one\'s fellow man and that such
            spiritual achievement was a consequence of the individual\'s own activity alone, without
            cooperation with his fellow men. This attitude appeared very clearly in Persian thinking
            about 600 B.C., came into Classical antiquity through the Pythagorean rationalists, and
            was given a clear, explicit, and influential statement in Plato\'s Phaedo about 385 B.C.
            Although quite incompatible with the Classical outlook, these ideas became increasingly
            influential and became the generally accepted philosophic outlook after the third
            century of our era. This led to a phenomenal outgrowth of anchoritism in the third to
            sixth centuries. It must be recognized that this philosophic position was basically
            incompatible with the religious ideas of Christianity. The latter has been threatened
            ever since by dualistic heresies (like Arianism, Catharism, or Jansenism) derived from
            this philosophic background.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Western ideology believed that the world was good because it was made
            by God in six
            days and that at the end of each day He looked at His work and said that it was good.
            This meant that the world was a comprehensible place (one of the basic ideas of Western
            science) and that its existence unfolded in time (not by instantaneous creation or
            through eternal existence). The body was also good, being made by God in His own image.
            Man needed others in order to develop his capacities in time, and he needed his body,
            his fellow men, and God\'s help, as well as his own efforts to achieve, over time,
            salvation in the future. This salvation included the body as well as the soul
            (\"resurrection of the body and life everlasting\") and could be achieved by good works
            (requiring a body and one\'s fellow men) and God\'s grace (granted by God Himself taking
            a
            human body and living in time in this world). All of these things were clearly stated in
            the New Testament, and the objections to them arising from Classical dualism were firmly
            rejected at the first church council held at Nicaea in 325. The full implications of the
            injunction to \"love thy neighbor\" were not completely unfolded in these two steps but
            continue to be so through the present and into the future.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;While the aristocratic Classical culture had put the golden age in the
            past, more
            democratic Western culture put it (and salvation) in the future. This optimistic and
            hopeful attitude applied to most aspects of Western life. Its hierarchical aspect
            appeared originally in the belief that the spiritual rested on the material (not opposed
            to it) and also came to apply to much of life. This led to a basic distinction (now
            largely lost) between necessary and important, in which material things were necessary
            but spiritual things were important.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The democratic and individualistic aspects of the Western outlook were
            always present,
            and go back, like other aspects, to the New Testament. They rest on the belief that all
            men have souls fit for salvation and, in the long run, have equal opportunity to achieve
            salvation. These ideas also appear in Christ\'s concern with the downtrodden and
            oppressed, in the belief that the first and greatest sin was pride (the sin of Lucifer)
            and that the greatest virtue was humility, in the Beatitudes and in many parables (such
            as that of the lost sheep). It is worthy of note that all these points are concerned not
            only with the individual\'s relationship to himself and to God but also with his
            relationship to his fellow men. All these, along with the emphasis on good works and the
            importance of sacraments, show the significance of the social element in Western
            thought. The same significance was underlined in the idea that man can be fully man and
            fully please God only in society. This idea was reflected in religion in the idea of the
            church (the societas perfecta), the belief that salvation could be obtained most readily
            through the church, the idea of the sacraments (all of which require the presence of at
            least two persons and most of which require three), the efforts, in the sixth century,
            to replace anchorites with monks (that is, to replace a late Classical aberration with a
            system more compatible with Western sociality).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;All these different aspects of the Western outlook cluster about the
            essence of the
            outlook that we have tried to express in the statement that \"Truth unfolds through a
            communal process.\" The outlook to which this statement refers lies at the foundation of
            Western culture and is reflected equally in its religion, its politics, its science, and
            its economics.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This outlook assumes, first, that there is a truth or goal for man\'s
            activity. Thus it
            rejects despair, solipsism, skepticism, pessimism, and chaos. It implies hope, order,
            and the existence of a meaningful objective external reality. And it provides the basis
            for science, religion, and social action as the West has known these.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Second, this attitude assumes that no one, now, has the truth in any
            complete or even
            adequate way; it must be sought or struggled for. Thus this outlook rejects smugness,
            complacency, pride, and personal authority in favor of the Christian virtues and a kind
            of basic agnosticism (with the implication \"We don\'t yet know everything\"), as well
            as
            the idea of achievement of good through struggle to reach the good. The earliest great
            work of German literature, Parzival, has as its subtitle \"The Brave Man Slowly Wise.\"
            This is typical of the Western ideology\'s belief that wisdom (or any real achievement)
            comes as a consequence of personal effort in time. The same idea is to be found in
            Dante\'s Divine Comedy, in Shakespeare\'s tragedies (taken as a whole), and in
            Beethoven\'s
            symphonies.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There are two important ideas here: one is that no one has the whole
            truth now but
            that it can be approached closer and closer in the future, by vigorous effort, and the
            other is that no single individual does this or achieves this, but that it must be
            achieved by a communal effort, by a kind of cooperation in competition in which each
            individual\'s efforts help to correct the errors of others and thus help the development
            of a consensus that is closer to the truth than the actions of any single individual
            ever could be. We might call these two aspects the temporal and the social. They are
            covered in our maxim by the words \"unfolds\" and \"social.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There is also a third idea here; namely, that the resulting consensus
            is still not
            final, although far superior to any earlier or more individual version. Thus the advance
            of mankind or of any single individual is an endless process in which truth (or any
            achievement, even the development of an individual\'s personality) is constantly
            approached closer and closer without ever being finished or reached.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might mention also another phase of this outlook; namely, the idea
            that the
            cooperative effort that unfolds truth through a continuously developing consensus is a
            competitive process. More accurately it is cooperation through competition, as a game
            is. This refers to a social process that is superficially competitive but fundamentally
            cooperative, or, viewed in another way, a situation in which individuals compete and
            even struggle together for a higher social end (the consensus). This is a dialectic
            process and is one of the heritages from Classical antiquity, where this idea of the
            emergence of truth from pluralistic debate in the market place is found in the earlier
            dialogues of Plato and of other thinkers. It is worthy of note that Plato, while
            retaining the form of the dialogue, really abandoned its function in his later writings
            (the Republic and those following) by using Socrates as the spokesman of his own ideas
            that contain the whole truth, while the other speakers contribute nothing to the final
            achievement since their ideas are erroneous and must be corrected by Socrates.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This idea of the fruitful debate from which truth grows is the basis
            for the method of
            medieval intellectual advance (in spite of the erroneous theory so widely accepted that
            medieval ideas were rigid systems imposed by authority). This conception is of course
            found behind medieval exposition as in Abelard\'s Sic et Non or Aquinas\'s Summa
            theologica, but it is much more fully realized in the process by which medieval ideas
            were reached than in the form in which they were presented. However, in both there was a
            fundamental assumption that each presentation was temporary and not fully perfect and
            was subject to improvement in a later revision as a consequence of criticism. The idea,
            so widely spread today that the Summa theologica was a final, complete, and permanent
            presentation of its subject, was not held at the time by anyone, least of all by Aquinas
            himself. After all, the Angelic Doctor offered the world at least three versions of this
            subject—the Summa . . . contra Gentiles, the Summa theologica, and the incomplete but
            really much improved Compendium Theologiae.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This attitude, to which I have referred by the maxim about the social
            unfolding of
            truth, is the basis of the Western religious outlook. This outlook believed that
            religious truth unfolded in time and is not yet complete. The Old Testament, for example
            was not cancelled or replaced by the New Testament but was supplemented by it. And the
            New Testament was never, in most of the life of Western civilization, regarded as a
            literal, explicit, and final statement of the truth. Rather, recognition of its truths
            has to be developed in time, by social action, from basically symbolic statements. Thus
            the doctrine of the Christian church was unfolded through church councils (like that at
            Nicaea) and by conferences of learned doctors and clerics, without ever any feeling that
            the process was finished. The fundamentalist position on biblical interpretation, with
            its emphasis on the explicit, complete, final, and authoritarian nature of Scripture, is
            a very late, minority view quite out of step with the Western tradition.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Closely related to this idea of the unfolding of doctrine through the
            church is the
            idea of the development of the individual, both in life and in death, toward the
            Beatific Vision. The same idea about the social (and dialectic) unfolding of truth is at
            the foundation of Western science. It assumes that science is never static or fully
            achieved, but pursues a constantly receding goal to which we approach closer and closer
            from the competition-cooperation of individual scientists, each of whom offers his
            experiments and theories to be critically re-examined and debated by his fellow
            scientists in a joint effort to reach a higher (and temporary) consensus.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The same outlook appears in the basic political ideas of the West.
            These are liberal
            and not authoritarian. They cannot be authoritarian because no individual or institution
            has full and final truth; instead a fuller and more complete truth emerges as a guide to
            social activity from the free debate in free assembly of all men\'s partial truths. Thus
            liberalism in this sense is basic in the outlook of the West and goes back, as we
            indicated earlier, to the dissociation of state and society in the Dark Ages when the
            former vanished and the latter continued. In its narrowest version this idea appeared as
            the theory that all men with different outlooks or contributions cooperate together to
            form something greater than the partial opinions of any of them. This kind of pluralism
            is assumed by the Polycraticus of John of Salisbury in the twelfth century as much as it
            is assumed by the United States Constitution in the eighteenth century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The same kind of pluralist outlook is the real justification of
            capitalism and of all
            laissez-faire or pluralist economic systems so typical of the West even in its early
            period when economic development was taking its first steps. It is the outlook behind
            the nineteenth century \"Community of Interests\" that has been exposed to such critical
            onslaughts in the twentieth century but yet remains as the unstated assumption behind
            our economic attitudes as they operate in actions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus we see the basic ideology of the West reflected in all aspects of
            the society,
            and continuing to influence ideas and actions even after it has been explicitly
            rejected. It is, for example, behind the theories of such late and \"unconventional\"
            thinkers as Darwin or Marx, both of whom believed that the Better emerged from the Good
            by the superficial struggles of the many to achieve what could never have been reached
            by any single individual alone. In fact, of these two, Marxist dialectic materialism is
            rather closer to the Western tradition than Darwin\'s struggle for existence is. Marx,
            like his mentor Hegel, was Western in his belief that progress is achieved through
            struggle, but, like Hegel, he committed the Western sin of pride (the sin of Lucifer) in
            the intellectual arrogance which expected achievement of a final goal in the material
            world and in the near future.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Part of the difficulty to be found in analysis of the history of
            Western civilization
            arises from the vicissitudes of the \"Western tradition.\" These difficulties were
            present
            throughout Western history. In the early period (say up to 1150) the difficulty arose
            from the fact that the religious outlook and practices of our society were incompatible
            with the intellectual outlook and philosophy derived from the dualistic ideas of the
            Platonic and Neoplatonic tradition. Thus, in a figure like Augustine, we find a
            Christian religious outlook combined with a Platonic philosophic outlook with which it
            is really not compatible. One consequence of this situation was a great prevalence of
            dualistic heresies. These were condemned as part of the religious settlement at Nicaea
            in 325, but they were not really overcome in philosophy until the twelfth century. At
            this latter time the triumph of moderate realism, as represented by Abelard, Albertus
            Magnus, or Thomas Aquinas, over exaggerated realism, as represented by St. Anselm or
            William of Champeaux, represented the achievement, within Christian society, of a
            philosophy that was compatible with its religious outlook. The official acceptance by
            the papacy in the early fourteenth century of Thomism, in spite of the attacks of the
            exaggerated realists, sealed this victory. Such a victory, in accordance with the
            tradition of the West, was not a victory of one extreme view over another but rather a
            moderate synthesis of the extremes in a higher unity. Thus the exaggerated realist
            extremists said that the universal was real and that the individual was an illusion (a
            position totally incompatible with Christianity and therefore never held, in this
            extreme form, by any orthodox Christian). At the other end of the spectrum, the
            nominalists said that the individual was real and that the universal was only a word (or
            a subjective concept). The Thomistic compromise, which was compatible with Christianity
            and the Western tradition, said that both the individual and the universal were real.
            This synthesis disrupted very soon into two extremist positions, represented in
            philosophy by Scotist realism and Occamite nominalism. The same scission into two
            extremes was found in religion during the late Middle Ages between these who advocated
            salvation through good works (like St. Francis of Assisi and Thomas à Kempis) and those
            who advocated salvation through God\'s grace (the new ascetics, mystics, and ultimately
            the Protestants), each group tending to place such emphasis on its own path to salvation
            as almost to deny the other extreme. Or again, within the church appeared a split
            between those who emphasized it as a temporal organization (and thus corrupted it) and
            those who emphasized it as a spiritual group, and thus (like Savonarola, Huss, and
            Luther) tended to deny its organization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From this it can be seen that the ideology of the Christian West was
            essentially a
            moderate one. It was constantly threatened, as moderates always are, by extremism. When
            these extremists argued for \"either-or,\" the Western tradition answered \"both!\" But
            this
            answer was no sooner given than new appeals by extremists sought to reopen the debate,
            to destroy the moderates, and to disrupt the synthesis. The extremists from one side
            (the Left, if you will) based their appeals on individualism, the senses, and
            materialism, and thus on the Christian insistence on the need of the world and the body.
            The extremists from the other side (the Right, we might say) based their appeal on
            society, rationalism, and spirituality, and thus on the Christian emphasis on the soul,
            God\'s grace, and the perfect rationality of God. Ultimately, in the history of ideas,
            the former extreme goes back to the Hebrews and to the Ionian atomists, while the latter
            extreme goes back to Persian Zorastrianism and to the Pythagorean rationalists, above
            all, to Plato. Within Western religious history (and the history of the church, which is
            both temporal and spiritual) these two extremes have been represented by corruption and
            by dualistic heresy. It is easy for us to see how corruption (that is, too great
            emphasis on the material and temporal aspect) destroys religion, but it is not so easy
            for many to see how too great spirituality (that is, too great emphasis on the
            nonmaterial and eternal aspect) can destroy religion. This condition arises because
            religion is a linking (from ligare, to join together, as in English \"ligament\" or
            \"ligature\") of the two extremes (man and God) that cannot exist if either extremity is
            absent.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the history of Western nonmaterial culture, including religion and
            philosophy, the
            threat to the synthesized moderate middle ground from the Right has come from dualistic
            rationalism and especially from the influence of Plato. This influence has worked
            historically through Augustine of Hippo, who was a Platonist in philosophy although a
            Christian in religion. In the field of religion itself, this influence has given rise to
            dualistic heresies of which the chief, as might be expected, have appealed to Augustine.
            Augustine himself was not a heretic. He said, \"Man is saved by God\'s grace,\" but he
            never said, \"Man is saved by God\'s grace alone.\" Since the orthodox position (the
            middle
            ground) was that man was saved by God\'s grace and his own good works among his fellow
            men, Augustine\'s statement was incomplete but not wrong (that is heretical). Only when
            this partial statement was accepted as a whole, complete, and final statement did it
            become heresy. But the tendency for the Rightest extremists to do this was very strong,
            and this tendency was most irresistible among those who were closest to the Augustinian
            tradition. Thus Luther, who was an Augustinian monk, did believe in salvation by grace
            alone, and the last great heresy (from the spiritual extremists) was Jansenism, which
            grew out of Jansen\'s book the Augustinus, a study of Augustine\'s theology (1632). This
            spread through figures like Pascal and the Port Royal group and was condemned as a
            heresy by the papacy in the bull Unigenitus in 1715.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Of course, the threat to the Western ideology based on synthetic
            moderation came
            equally, if not more, easily from the Left, from the materialists and nominalists. But
            this is a well-known story that needs to be mentioned here only because the loss of the
            ideology of Western civilization (like the earlier loss of the ideology of Classical
            civilization) will rest rather on the overemphasis on materialism and selfish
            individualism than it will on overemphasis of rationalism or spirituality.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In most civilizations, as we have already shown, there is a strong
            tendency for the
            basic ideology of the society to become lost and misunderstood during the Age of
            Conflict and to be abandoned totally in the Age of Decay. Since Western civilization has
            gone into an Age of Conflict three times, the threat to the society\'s ideology has been
            practically endemic. Anyone who wishes to recover this ideology can do so by reflecting
            on the word \"moderation\" or the expression \"reconciliation of extremes\" or, more
            abstrusely, on our maxim about the \"unfolding of truth through social activity over
            time.\" When our old professor said of Goethe that he was \"conciliatory,\" he was
            saying
            that he was a figure in the Western tradition; but when we say that Hitler was an
            extremist or a fanatic we are equally clearly excluding Hitler from the real Western
            tradition.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The mixture of cultural elements that formed Western society came from
            four chief
            sources. One of these was Classical culture, whose greatest influence was in law,
            government, philosophy, and science. Another was the Semitic influence, which came
            largely through Christianity and the Jewish people and thus spread its effects largely
            in the field of religion and morality. The third influence, that of the barbarians, was
            a very diffused one, and is chiefly notable in social relations and technology; while
            the last, coming from the Saracens, consists mostly in incidental items and served also
            as an intermediary in the transfer of Classical influences.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The creation of the new society was a lengthy and painful process in
            which the most
            vital changes occurred at opposite ends of the cultural spectrum in the areas of
            military technology and of religion. The religious influence, which we have already
            mentioned, served to divorce peoples\' allegiance from Classical culture and to focus it
            on a new ideology for which men were willing to sacrifice their wealth, leisure, and
            safety. The military influence sprang from the need to find a method by which Christian
            groups could be defended from the onslaughts of pagan invaders.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A Christian society could arise and maintain itself only if its
            members could be
            defended against non-Christian intruders. The older, Classical military tactics had been
            based on infantry, fighting in compact masses and highly disciplined so that they could
            not be broken under enemy attack but rather would remain in alignment and position so
            that each individual could be at least partly covered by the shield and sword of his
            neighbor. This infantry technique, which had undergone only slight modifications in the
            long period from the Greek hoplites and Macedonian phalanxes to Roman legions, had
            become completely obsolete in the fourth century of our era before the impact of
            charging horsemen. The threat from these horsemen rested not only on their possession of
            mounts but also on the fact that these horses could be used day after day without
            resting because hoof-wear was prevented by iron horseshoes, and the impact of their
            lances on standing men was greatly increased by the use of stirrups. We do not know
            exactly when horseshoes and stirrups were introduced into the West, but it is certain
            that they were invented fairly early in the Christian period in the Northern Flatlands
            of Asia, probably by one of the Ural-Altaic-speaking peoples, and were introduced into
            Europe during the period of barbarian migrations. It is possible that the Huns had these
            innovations as early as the fourth century, and this may well explain the horrors these
            people evoked in the West. One of the chief reasons for the widespread fear of the Huns
            rested on their ability to travel very long distances in relatively short periods. This
            ability may well have been based on their use of horseshoes.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The new military tactic of mounted men fighting in loose groups armed
            with lances or
            spears required so much skill and training that fighting men had to be specialists, free
            to practice because they were supported economically by others. This requirement made it
            inevitable that the new Christian society must be a two-class society divided into those
            who fought from horseback and those who produced the food to support all persons and
            their animals. The fighting man in this organization was very expensive because his
            horses (he needed at least two), his arms, and his leisure to practice fighting were
            expensive. This meant that the ratio, in the society, between soil tillers and fighters
            would be high, something in the order of a hundred to one. The specialized fighters and
            the specialized toil tillers in this organization were very unequal in power, although,
            perhaps, not so overwhelmingly unequal as we might guess. When the organization reached
            its full development in the late eleventh century, the knight provided all the
            protection and the peasant (by then usually a serf) provided all the food. The knight
            needed food as much as the peasant needed protection, but the time ratio between these
            needs was to the advantage of the knight to such an extent that he could use his power
            against the peasant in the short run (to enforce obedience) so long as he did not injure
            the peasant\'s capacity to produce food in the long run. This power ratio of knight and
            serf was so great that it was possible for knights to force serfs to contribute to their
            support beyond the amount necessary for the expenses of protection alone. Accordingly,
            there was a flow of the economic necessities produced by the serfs into the possession
            of the knights. Thus the medieval knight became a surplus-creating instrument as well as
            an instrument of defense, a political power, and the upper class in the social system.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This complex organization on the military, political, social, and
            economic levels is
            called feudalism. It was supported by an economic organization of self-sufficient
            agricultural units called manors, and acted as the surplus creating organization of the
            instrument of expansion of Western civilization in its first four stages. The whole
            system was supported by the economic production of the peasant. This latter relationship
            was so vital for the existence of the system that the peasant was legally forbidden to
            leave his position on the land and thus became a serf. On the whole, the peasant did not
            resist serfdom, since it gave him a secure status that provided protection and justice.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The period of mixture of Western civilization was merely a
            continuation of the period
            of invasion of Classical civilization and lasted from about A.D. 370 to at least 750. It
            was followed by a period of gestation of about two hundred years. The two periods
            together had to achieve three tremendous tasks: first, to bring into existence the new
            Christian society by creating relationships between groups and individuals and by
            establishing patterns of ideas and activity that would permit a new society to survive;
            second, to repel invasions of non-Christian cultures or to enforce conformity to the new
            Christian patterns by those who could not be expelled; and, third, the accumulation and
            investment functions of the instrument of expansion must begin to operate.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These three tasks were achieved in the order in which we have listed
            them, the first
            in the period of mixture, the third in the period of gestation, and the second bridging
            over both periods. This second was such a gigantic task that it delayed the achievement
            of the third task and led the society into political ambitions that could not possibly
            be supported by the economic base available. These ambitions took the form of the
            Carolingian Empire, whose brief life covered the generation before 814.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The task of repelling invaders from Christian society was
            extraordinarily successful.
            To us today it is still a puzzle as to how it was achieved. As late as 732 the Saracen
            invaders were only fifty miles from Paris, but as early as 1099 the Christian
            counterattack on the Saracens had captured Jerusalem. During most of this interval the
            attacks on the West continued, by Vikings and Northmen in the Baltic and North Sea
            areas, by pagan Germans and Turkic peoples from the East, and by the Saracens in the
            Mediterranean area. In one way or another, these peoples were pushed back or were
            adopted into Western society.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The success of these military achievements, especially by the
            Carolingians, led to
            their abortive effort to re-establish in Europe a recreated universal Roman Empire. This
            was an overextension of military and political ambitions quite unwarranted by the social
            and economic conditions. In terms of our analysis it meant that surpluses being
            accumulated by the political and military organizations were being expended in the same
            levels in an effort to expand on these levels more rapidly than the economic basis would
            allow. Before any centralized political system such as Charlemagne\'s could function
            steadily, it was necessary to achieve a very great expansion and intensification of the
            economic level by diverting the surpluses being accumulated on the political and
            military levels into the economic level.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The real difficulties on the political and military levels that made
            the Carolingian
            effort fail were in respect to three phenomena: (1) poor transportation, (2) poor
            communications, and (3) the superiority of defensive weapons. We have already mentioned
            that the old Roman Empire was supported on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea by the
            superiority of sea transportation over land transportation, thus binding the shores of
            the sea to each other more closely than any shore was bound to its own hinterland. The
            recreation of a universal Carolingian Empire would have needed a system of land
            transportation able to bind Europe into a unified whole. No such system existed or could
            exist in the year 800. Roads were almost totally lacking, and could not be supported in
            any adequate fashion by the limited output of the economic system. At that time Europe
            was just obtaining from the East an adequate method of harnessing, including the horse
            collar and traces, but this method was not yet widely known, and the economic system was
            not able to support any large number of horses or men devoted to transportation.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Closely related to the lack of transportation was the inadequacy of
            communications,
            including that basic item, the level of literacy. Literacy has been associated
            historically with the existence either of a priestly group seeking to keep records or of
            a commercial group seeking to communicate over a distance as well as to keep records.
            The transportation inadequacy that led to self-sufficient manors and the political
            disorder that gave a low level of personal security combined to make commerce almost
            impossible in the early medieval period. Without a commercial group, literacy thus was a
            monopoly of the clergy, but even here poverty and disorder led to a high degree of
            localism and a decrease in communication and in literacy. Without these things no
            centralized government could possibly function, and the Carolingian effort to establish
            one proved abortive. It is worthy of note that the subsequent revival of government,
            after the tenth century, followed very closely the revival of literacy among the clergy
            and a new commercial class and that rulers made use of these two groups in sequence to
            count their moneys and handle their communications and accounts.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The third factor in the disappearance of centralized government was
            the superiority of
            defensive weapons. For any government to function, it must be able to know what is
            happening at a distance, to communicate its orders, and to enforce obedience to these.
            The enforcement of obedience to orders cannot go further than the limit of the
            superiority of offensive power over defensive power. In the year A.D. 900 there was no
            such superiority. On the contrary, the defense was superior over the offensive to a
            degree that has never been exceeded in the historic period, even during its nearest
            analogy—the Mediterranean world about 1000 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The military system of Europe about A.D. 1000 is of extraordinary
            interest because it
            was built about two \"supreme weapons,\" neither of which could defeat the other. These
            were the mounted knight and the castle. Quite obviously, a castle could not defeat a
            knight. And, almost equally obviously, a knight could not defeat a castle. The only way
            that a knight or group of knights could defeat a castle was by siege, but this was
            extremely difficult during the early Middle Ages because of the technical difficulty of
            supplying a besieging force at a distance so that it could starve out the defenders
            before it starved itself from exhaustion of supplies. Any besieging force had to be
            stronger than the besieged or it would be driven from the area and the siege broken. But
            to maintain a superior besieging force placed an almost impossible burden on the
            available transport. The besiegers could starve out the besieged only if they could
            supply a larger force at a distance than the besieged had available in their own stores.
            This was such an unlikely possibility for much of the Middle Ages that a castle remained
            as a supreme defensive weapon for most of that period. Politically this means that
            anyone who had a castle could say \"no\" to any order and could not be forced to submit.
            This means that every such castle became a nucleus of political independence and, since
            there were thousands of such castles in Europe about 1000, it meant that Europe was
            divided into thousands of independent political units and that centralized political
            power over any extended area was impossible. In this situation the clash of knight
            against knight was much less significant, for a knight, even when defeated on the field,
            could not be made to obey if he could retire into his castle.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The defensive superiority of the castle inhibited the growth of larger
            political units
            longer than the inadequacy of transportation might warrant because of the intrusion of
            other factors. One of these delaying factors is to be found in the organization of
            feudalism itself. Feudal relationships sought to organize over larger areas by
            subinfeudation. By this process a lord would be owed military service and advice
            (auxilium et concilium) from a large number of vassals, each supported by an economic
            unit (fief) organized in manors. Efforts to organize these relationships into larger and
            larger systems led to problems that students o organization call \"problems of span.\"
            If,
            for example, the king of France had the right to expect 5,000 knights to answer his
            summons to military service, he would face an insoluble problem of span if he had to
            send out 5,000 individual summonses because he had 5,000 separate individual vassals. To
            avoid this the lord reduced the number of his direct vassals to a manageable span by
            requiring numerous knights\' services from each vassal. Thus the king of France could
            still summon 5,000 fighting men to service if he had 50 vassals each of whom owed 100
            fighting men\'s services or if he divided up the 5,000 into any two factors whose
            product
            would provide 5,000 men. The vassals who owed plural service could obtain the necessary
            fighting men by subinfeudating the fiefs that supported these fighters to their own
            vassals, or through them to their vassals\' vassals. As these relationships became
            established, each vassal sought to specify what he owed his lord, and thus there
            gradually arose customary limits on the military service a lord could demand from his
            vassals. In many areas these limits came to be understood as no more than forty days\'
            military service each year and at no greater distance than two or three days\' ride
            (forty to fifty miles) from the vassal\'s residence. These limits made it impossible to
            besiege a castle successfully within the limits, and this served to extend the defensive
            invulnerability of a castle against feudal forces even after the period when the
            inadequacy of transportation had hampered sieges.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The interplay of these influences, and others not yet mentioned, were
            such as to
            create three subperiods in the history of castle defense and thus in the history of
            political development. The first period, when transportation inadequacy was the chief
            factor, is the period of political feudalism. This political period continued until the
            late eleventh century because of the importance of limitations on a vassal\'s military
            service in feudal customary law. Eventually feudal knights began to be replaced by
            similar fighters serving for pay rather than for feudal obligation. These mercenary
            men-at-arms (as they are called) served as long as they were paid, and thus could
            capture a castle by siege simply by starving it out if transport of supplies was
            adequate. Since all possessors of castles did not have sufficient economic resources to
            obtain mercenary men-at-arms, those who did could besiege those who did not and force
            obedience upon the latter. This led to a reduction in the number of independent
            political units because it reduced the number who could refuse obedience to orders. Thus
            the number of political units in Europe became less, and the areas over which their
            orders could be enforced (or over which their \"writ ran,\" as the saying went) became
            larger. This led to a second stage in the development of European political
            organization, known as \"feudal monarchy.\" The number of political units in Europe was
            reduced from thousands to hundreds.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The next step forward in the development of the political level
            reduced the number of
            European political units from hundreds to scores and gave us a new stage in political
            development to which we apply the name \"dynastic monarchy.\" The military factor that
            contributed to its growth was the rise of artillery that made the private stone castle
            obsolete, since guns could shatter the walls of a castle and thus force its owner to
            submit. Artillery first appeared about 1325, but its effects were not clearly evident
            for two hundred years. Then they became so clear that when a great lord wanted a
            residence after 1530 he built a palace rather than a castle. In this way, at the price
            of political submission to the royal artillery, the lord obtained an indefensible, but
            much more comfortable, residence at a lower cost.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The number of lords with the financial and economic resources to
            obtain artillery was,
            of course, much less than the number who had mercenary men-at-arms, so that the former
            could enforce obedience from the latter. Political units became fewer in number and
            larger in area. The possession of artillery became the dividing line between public
            authority and private power, and later between possession of castles and the lack, as
            well as between the possession of a royal title and its lack. All these served to demark
            a period of \"dynastic monarchy\" in the political level at the rough date 1500.

            impossible for the feudal organization to amass surpluses and to direct these surpluses
            into expansive channels. Only in the final quarter of the tenth century was this
            situation reversed, and a new period of expansion, the first in Western civilization,
            began.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The first stage of expansion in Western civilization lasted for about
            three centuries
            (970-1270) and was one of the greatest of such periods in human history. Its instrument
            of expansion was the feudal system in which a small minority of fighting men and clergy
            were supported by a great majority of peasants. The contributions of the latter to the
            former were far greater than the costs of protection and justice they received in
            return, so that surpluses accumulated in the possession of the upper class. At first
            these surpluses were used for political ends, to build castles or to rebuild older
            timbered fortifications in stone. But soon investment in economic activities began. This
            appeared either in agriculture or in the encouragement of long-distance commerce in
            luxury goods. The agricultural expansion was extensive, and took the form of
            establishing manors in unfilled areas by clearing wastelands or forests or by draining
            swamplands. When this was done by secular lords, the new manors were generally similar
            to the older manors of the self-sufficient, balanced three-field type. But increasingly
            the manors spread by clerical, above all by monastic, groups were of a new type
            producing still the basic needs of their own inhabitants but adding to this an
            increasing surplus output of some product for sale off the manor. In grassy or hilly
            areas these surplus products from new manors were likely to be wool, wines, or dairy
            products (chiefly cheeses), but in ordinary terrain it might be grain.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The accumulation of surplus in the hands of \"the lords spiritual and
            temporal\" also
            created a demand for remote luxury goods derived from commerce. From the eastern forests
            opened by Varangians there came, by way of the Baltic, various forest products such as
            furs, honey, wax, and later hemp, tar, and even lumber. From the Levant there came
            across the Mediterranean more exotic products, including fine textiles, fine metal
            products, spices, and dyes. Eventually, links between these two great sea routes were
            established, the earliest being the Russian river route, then from Italy across the
            Brenner to Innsbruck, Nuremberg, and the North German rivers, or across the western
            Alpine passes to the Rhone, Champagne, and the northwestern rivers to the Low Countries.
            In the first part of the fourteenth century an all-sea link was opened by way of the
            Strait of Gibraltar and Bay of Biscay to the Narrow Seas.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The revival of commerce, especially in the twelfth century, gave rise
            to a new social
            class isolated from the agricultural process, and living in towns rather than on manors.
            This new middle class, or bourgeoisie, created such a demand for the necessities of life
            that a new kind of commerce, of local origin and concerned with necessities, appeared.

            religious problems. Taken together these provide a fairly typical example of Stage 3 in

            To a lesser degree, and somewhat belated, can be seen the growth of science, but
            democratic elements, while present, were unable to develop far because of the continued

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The old view of our grandfathers that the Middle Ages was a static and
            backward era is
            now accepted by almost no one, but it is not so generally recognized that medieval
            expansion was slowing down by the end of the thirteenth century and that the society was
            entering upon a typical age of conflict. The three hundred years of expansion that were
            drawing to a close as Aquinas died in 1274 had been financed by the demand of the upper
            classes for luxury goods of distant origin. In time this demand was reinforced and
            extended by the demands of the successful commercial groups for both luxuries and
            necessities. But by 1274 the feudal organization, especially the feudal lords, had
            become institutionalized into an obsolescent structure with few functions and a powerful
            determination to resist further change and to defend its own social position. This
            institutionalized feudalism is called chivalry. As a military system it was being
            replaced by royal and ducal forces based on mercenary men-at-arms. As a political
            influence it was being replaced by royal and princely rulers served by clerical or even
            bourgeois officials. These latter had, for the prince, the great advantage that they
            could count, keep records, and were literate, and yet had no independent military power
            of their own. Even as a social group, the feudal nobility were being challenged by
            persons of other origins, such as royal officials, clerical leaders, and wealthy
            bourgeoisie. The nobility had no desire to continue the process of change that had
            brought them to this situation, but they were in no position to stop continued
            development.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;One of the chief consequences of these economic changes was the advent
            of a money
            economy. As a result of this, all relationships in society developed a tendency to
            become expressed in monetary terms. This was true of the relationships that each noble
            lord had with his vassals in the feudal system and with his serfs in the manorial
            system. The aid and counsel owed by the vassal in the former case, as well as the dues
            and services owed by the serf in the latter, were, sooner or later, transformed from
            obligations to pay in kind to obligations to pay in money.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Each change was made at the going rate of value, so that the nobles
            ceased to have
            fixed incomes in kind and began to have fixed incomes in money. But the steady rise in
            prices up to 1300 meant that the value of fixed-money incomes was steadily reduced;
            every year a fixed income would buy less. This rise in prices and equivalent fall in the
            value of money occurred because both the amount of money in circulation and the speed
            with which it circulated increased faster than the increase in the volume of goods
            available (although this was also increasing).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The reduction of noble incomes by the decreasing value of money meant
            that less could
            be saved from these incomes. Thus there was less and less available for investment. If
            we consider that the price level was about three times as high in 1300 as it had been at
            the end of the tenth century, we shall see that a noble who commuted his income into
            money at the earlier date would have only one-third as much real income at the later
            date. No one, of course, was quite this badly off, for the simple reason that no one
            commuted as early as the tenth century, and the later the commutation the less the loss,
            but by the end of the thirteenth century most nobles were being reduced to desperation.
            This situation was made even worse by the fact that the institutionalization of the
            nobility led to customary and legal restrictions on their activities that made it very
            difficult for them to supplement their decreasing real incomes. On the Continent
            generally (but not in England), they were forbidden to engage in commerce or to marry
            nonnoble girls. These restrictions made it impossible for the nobility to obtain access
            to incomes from the commercial class (as was done in England, where there were a peerage
            and an aristocracy but no nobility).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The result of all these noble misfortunes was that the only feasible
            way in which a
            noble could supplement his income was as a mercenary soldier or, possibly, as a royal
            bureaucrat. The latter was unlikely because writing and counting were not noble skills.
            Thus a noble was inclined to seek to supplement his income from war. This need became
            the basis for the imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict that began at the end of the
            thirteenth century. English wars against the Scots, Welsh, Irish, and French; French
            wars with the English, Burgundians, and others; the almost endless struggles among the
            princes, both lay and clerical, of Italy and Germany; all these, as well as civil
            struggles such as the Wars of the Roses, the struggles of the Armagnacs, or the Sicilian
            Vespers, helped to provide jobs for the impoverished feudal nobility.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The economic crisis that emerged from the decrease of feudal spending
            was delayed only
            briefly by the continuance of saving and investment by commercial groups. The economic
            life of the towns, including both commercial and crop activities, became
            institutionalized in the fourteenth century largely by the activities of the guilds. As
            demand ceased to grow, these adopted restrictive regulations, preventing admission of
            new workers to most activities and, under the pretext of protecting the quality of the
            products, curtailed output and increased prices. At the same time towns placed all kinds
            of restrictions (generally known as municipal mercantilism) on business activities.
            These included restricting commercial exchange to set times and places (the market),
            putting restrictions on nontownspeople in the town market, forbidding purchases for
            later sale in the same market, hampering or taxing export of goods from the town, and so
            forth. All such regulations, embodying what is technically called \"a policy of
            provision,\" had a very adverse influence on technological advance for most of the
            fourteenth century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The decrease in expansion arising from the growth of economic
            institutionalization was
            accelerated by a number of other factors. One of these was a fall of prices after 1300,
            accompanied, within a half-century, by a scarcity of labor. The fall of prices probably
            began with the decrease in demand arising from institutionalization, but it was greatly
            accelerated by the scarcity of bullion. By the year 1300 the accessible silver mines and
            scanty gold resources of Europe had been systematically exploited for about four
            centuries and most of the easily obtained bullion had been extracted. Mines were
            becoming exhausted or were going deeper than could be operated easily by the available
            technology. The problem of keeping water out of the deeper mines was rapidly becoming
            insoluble. The ordinary lift pumps known at the time would not take water higher than
            about thirty feet, since they worked by air pressure, so that depths greater than this
            have to be pumped out in multiple stages. Problems of ventilation and of removing ores
            were also rising rapidly. As a consequence, after about 1320 the annual increase in the
            bullion supply and thus the increase in the volume of money were less than the increase
            in production of goods, and the long rise in prices was reversed. Costs, particularly
            wages, did not fall so rapidly as prices, with the result that profit margins (price
            minus costs) were reduced or wiped out completely. This discouraged production. The
            situation was alleviated for a short time just at the middle of the fourteenth century
            because the outbreak of the Hundred Years\' War in 1338 helped to strengthen prices, but
            profit margins hardly benefited at all, because the shortage of labor resulting from the
            onslaughts of the Black Death after 1348 raised wages. Even today, when wages constitute
            a smaller portion of total costs, nothing will curtail production faster or more
            completely than rising wages in a time of falling prices. One rather paradoxical
            consequence of this situation was that incomes were distributed somewhat more equitably,
            and the standards of living of the poorer groups frequently improved in spite of the
            general economic decline. This meant that aggregate incomes, as a whole, were
            decreasing, but the share of the total income going to the working people was rising and
            the share of the upper classes was falling quite rapidly. As a consequence of this, both
            saving and investment (which were upper-class activities) decreased even more rapidly,
            and the depression worsened.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This economic and social crisis of the fourteenth and early fifteenth
            centuries is
            well documented in the historical records. Josiah C. Russell tells us that the British
            population was 1.1 million in 1086 and rose very rapidly until about 1240, then
            increased more slowly during the next century and achieved a peak of about 3.7 million
            in 1348; it then decreased to 2.23 million by 1377 and to 2.1 million in the early
            fifteenth century and was still at no more than 3.2 million in 1545. M. M. Postan tells
            us that all the towns of England, except Bristol and London, lost population from the
            fourteenth century to the fifteenth century. A similar pattern was being experienced on
            the Continent. E. Baratier and F. Raynaud report the population of Marseilles fell by at
            least 75 percent in the period 1263 to 1423. Similar trends have been reported from most
            of western and central Europe. C. M. Cipolla says that the crises of the early decades
            of the fourteenth century were comparable in their gravity to those that struck the
            modern world in 1929- 35. In his study of Italian businessmen, Y. Renouard says that
            economic enterprise was replaced by warfare after 1330 as the accepted method for making
            one\'s fortune. An old work of R. Davidsohn\'s gives us fairly specific figures for the
            manufacture of woolen cloth in Florence in the fourteenth century: 100,000 pieces in
            1309, only 70,000 in 1339, falling to 30,000 in 1373, and reaching 19,000 in 1382.

            in France occurred the revolts of the Jacquerie and other disorders; while in Germany
            (as a semiperipheral area) these outbursts came somewhat later, culminating in the

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The debasement of Europe\'s material, social, and spiritual life which
            had continued
            for over a century and a half was reversed, quite suddenly, just before the middle of
            the fifteenth century. About 1440 new life began to spring up, with new hopes and
            renewed ambitions. This new growth was based on the activities of a new instrument of
            expansion, commercial capitalism, a complete circumvention of the previous feudal
            organization that had originated the older period of expansion in the tenth century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This new instrument of expansion, which we call commercial capitalism,
            was a
            circumvention of feudalism, but it could just as well be regarded as a reform of the
            commercial organization of the Middle Ages. In the earlier period, demand, originally of
            feudal origin, had given rise to a commercial system whose symbols are Bruges, Venice,
            and Nuremberg. In the new age of expansion which began about 1440, the original demand
            came from princes and dynastic monarchies, and gave rise to a new commercial
            organization whose symbols are Cadiz, Antwerp, and London. One aspect of the change is
            the shift from institutionalized Mediterranean commerce to instrumental Atlantic
            commerce. After the original impulse (feudalism or dynastic monarchy as the case may be)
            both organizations were capitalistic and commercial. By capitalism we mean \"an economic
            system motivated by the pursuit of profits within a price structure.\" Such profits can
            be derived either from the exchange of goods (as happened in commercial capitalism) or
            from the production of goods (as occurred in the third period of Western expansion,
            which began about 1720). Either type of capitalism can become institutionalized, in
            which case profits are sought not from exchange or from production of goods but from
            restrictions on exchange and restrictions on production. This restrictive capitalism
            arose because profits (which are the real motive of any capitalistic system) are the
            margin between selling prices and costs. As long as a capitalistic organization is an
            instrument, it seeks to increase profits by reducing costs rather than by increasing
            prices; but when a capitalistic system becomes an institution, it shifts its efforts to
            trying to increase profits by increasing prices. Such increases in prices can generally
            be achieved only by reducing the flow of goods (either by restricting exchange or by
            restricting production). An effort to make this the chief method for maximizing profits
            indicates institutionalization of the organization. We have three different names for
            institutionalized capitalist systems which were dominant in the three Ages of Conflict
            of Western civilization. These are municipal mercantilism in the period 1270-1440, state
            mercantilism in the period 1690-1810, and monopoly capitalism in the period 1900 and
            after.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The new Age of Expansion after 1440 lasted until near the end of the
            seventeenth
            century. It is very familiar to all students of history and is frequently called the
            ambiguous term \"Renaissance.\" Even a neophyte in the study of history is aware that
            this
            period possessed the qualities we have listed as typical of any Age of Expansion:
            increased production, rising population, geographic expansion, growth of knowledge, and
            intermittent impulses of science and democracy. Except for geographical expansion and
            science, all these were probably less extreme, in a quantitative sense, than history
            textbooks might lead us to believe, but I think there can be no doubt that they existed
            sufficiently to justify the name \"expansion\" for the period as a whole. The two most
            dramatic aspects of the period, however, are to be seen in science and in exploration
            and colonization. In science the period from Copernicus, or even Leonardo, to Newton is
            recognized as one of the most brilliant in all history, while in geographic expansion
            the age of Vasco da Gama or Magellan is no less famous. In both of these fields, and in
            the others as well, the period of a century or more after 1690 is one of much more
            modest achievements. Only in the nineteenth century, with the surge of a new Age of
            Expansion, were the achievements of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries
            generally exceeded.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The successive stages of expansion and conflict that we are trying to
            distinguish in
            the past thousand years of the history of our own civilization are even less definitely
            demarked than similar stages in other civilizations. In addition to certain difficulties
            already mentioned, such as the inevitable lack of perspective occurring when we study
            our own society, there are other difficulties that arise from the cyclical character of
            these stages. Cultural lag and aberrations that emerge from the contrast between core
            and peripheral zones are especially troublesome in a civilization that repeats stages.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already mentioned the problems that arise in demarking stages
            from the fact
            that such stages tend to be somewhat later in peripheral areas than they are in core
            areas. When stages are repeated, as in Western civilization, this gives rise to
            particular difficulties because peripheral areas could, in theory, fall one full stage
            behind the core area and thus mask the fluctuating process in the civilization as a
            whole. Fortunately, Western civilization did not have a full stage lag in its peripheral
            areas, but the lag was sufficiently prolonged to provide a masking influence on the
            demarcations of stages. In general, the core of Western civilization could be regarded
            as the northern half of Italy, France, the Low Countries, extreme western Germany, and
            England without its Celtic fringes. The masking effect arose because of continued
            expansion in Germany and in the New World after this core had already moved into the
            next stage. There can be little doubt that the shift from expansion to conflict that
            occurred in the core of Western Europe at the end of the thirteenth century arrived
            somewhat later in Germany. Again, when Western Europe resumed expansion about 1440,
            Germany continued in the period of conflict for another century. And, finally, when the
            second stage of expansion reached its end in Western Europe in the late seventeenth
            century, it continued in Germany and in Mexico for several generations more. On the
            other hand, about 1840, when England, France, and, above all, Belgium were expanding
            vigorously in the third occurrence of expansion of Western civilization, Germany and
            Mexico were just about to resume expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The masking effect between stages to which we refer was intensified by
            cultural lag.
            This means that in any single area, be it core or not, all aspects of the society do not
            start, stop, or proceed at the same times and rates. In general, change or innovation
            was earlier in the military and economic aspects than it was in the political, social,
            legal, or intellectual aspects. This can be seen quite clearly in the early sixteenth
            century and again in the late eighteenth century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The last imperialist war of the first Age of Conflict was the series
            of struggles
            called the Italian Wars (1494-1559). These began with an excuse rather than a cause,
            just as the earlier Hundred Years\' War (1338-1445) had done. The cause of both of these
            was the need for the institutionalized feudal system to wage war in order to make a
            living. In other words war had become an end in itself, as is usually the case with any
            institution. The excuse given in 1338 for the English invasion of France, like the
            excuse given in 1494 for Charles VIII\'s invasion of Italy, was no more than that— just
            an excuse—a flimsy dynastic claim to a distant throne. But in each case hordes of
            unemployed nobles were eager to support such a claim, no matter how flimsy, for the sake
            of booty and payment for military service.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The first imperialist wars of the new Age of Conflict were the wars of
            Louis XIV,
            which began in 1667 and which continued, with interruptions, until after Waterloo in
            1815. The excuses that Louis XIV gave for his wars were just about as flimsy as those
            which had been offered in 1338 and 1494 in the earlier Ages of Conflict, and were
            repeated in the last of these wars by Napoleon.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As far as our analysis goes, the Italian Wars of 1494-1559 should have
            been followed
            by a period of peace such as followed the Napoleonic Wars of 1803-15, since, in each
            case, a new period of expansion had begun. Let us note that expansion had fully begun
            even before these last imperialist wars commenced, since the second Age of Expansion
            began about 1440 and the third began about 1730. This was simply a result of cultural
            lag, and reflected a situation where older institutions continued to work for a war that
            newer instrumental developments had made unnecessary and unrewarding. A similar and
            parallel situation may be existing now, at the middle of the twentieth century, if we
            are endangered by imperialist war at a time when new instruments and techniques of
            peaceful expansion have already begun to function.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the period 1815-1914, of course, there was an absence of
            imperialist war, and
            Europe was generally concentrating its resources and energies on expansion, and did so
            because the fact of expansion, especially the new industrialism, was too obvious for
            anyone to ignore the fact that it was more feasible to get ahead by peaceful methods
            than by warlike ones. But in the period of expansion from 1440 to 1680 this was not
            nearly so clear, chiefly because of cultural lag of behavior and thought patterns from
            the earlier Age of Conflict.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have said that the Italian Wars began in 1494 as a typical
            imperialist aggression
            by the institutionalized feudal system. But the war changed its character after about
            twenty-five years, and became a balance-of-power struggle against Hapsburg hegemony. In
            1494 the king of France was the aggressor; by 1520 the king of France was fighting for
            survival against a dynastic monster that had come into existence through a series of
            circumstances, some of them accidental, which had made the Hapsburgs the overwhelming
            power in Europe. Among these circumstances were the family arrangements that accumulated
            by inheritance a large number of important dynastic claims in the hands of Charles V of
            the Holy Roman Empire. Of almost equal importance was the accidental circumstance that
            the same Hapsburgs, as rulers of Mexico and Peru, were able to tap the immense resources
            of bullion of America at a time when the existence of mercenary armies made money
            equivalent to soldiers and thus to power.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The influx of American bullion that made the Hapsburgs a great
            military and political
            power without an economic or social system capable of supporting a hegemony of Europe
            had several results. By raising prices rapidly it completed the ruin of the older
            nobility and any other persons on fixed incomes. At the same time this price inflation
            gave a great spur to economic (especially commercial) expansion and to the growth in
            wealth and influence of the bourgeoisie and richer peasants. Moreover, the revelation
            that the possession of money could make a dynasty powerful even without a sound economic
            and social system to support it fastened the mercantilist system, in a broader, more
            exploitative, way upon Europe. Political power supported by mercenary soldiers was used
            to regulate economic activities so that a favorable balance of trade would bring in
            sufficient money to hire mercenary soldiers and thus expand a dynasty\'s ability to
            control more taxpayers, get access to larger numbers of mercenary recruits, and to
            increase the favorable balance of payments.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These obsolescent ideas, which continued as a cultural lag during the
            course of the
            new, second Age of Expansion, ensured a continuance of imperialist wars even in the
            period of expansion. The struggle against Hapsburg hegemony that began after 1519 was
            ended with the Hapsburg political defeat in the Thirty Years\' War (1618-48); the
            struggle against French hegemony in Europe that began in 1667 continued until 1815. But
            the interval between these two struggles, which should have been a period of peace, was
            not, because of economic struggles, such as the three Anglo- Dutch Wars, which were
            justified by institutionalized mercantilist ideologies.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Moreover, only local and sporadic movements toward democracy appeared
            in this period
            of expansion because the organization of military force and of political power was not
            such as to permit democracy to function. The Italian Wars of 1494-1559 were like a
            caldron in which a great variety of military ideas and tactics were thrown together and
            tested. Among these were the old mounted knight, the new infantry of English crossbowmen
            or Swiss pikemen, the even newer infantry of arquebusiers, the light cavalry (reiter)
            armed with \"horse pistols,\" primitive artillery, and even a Spanish revival of the
            Roman
            legionary. From the competition of these various arms there emerged by 1559 a tactical
            combination of pike and arquebus that held the field for over two centuries. In this
            combination the pikemen defended the arquebusiers against charging horsemen, while the
            arquebusiers defended the pikemen against forearms. At first, slowness of reloading,
            which left arquebusiers in jeopardy from cavalry for long intervals, required a high
            ratio of pikemen in the unit, but the slow increase in rate of firing and the invention
            of the ring bayonet (which made each musketeer able \"to act as his own pikeman\") in
            1690
            led to the reduction and eventual elimination of pikes. But the use of muskets, either
            with pikes or bayonets for defense against cavalry, supplemented by artillery, remained
            a skilled task as long as guns remained muzzle-loading, spark-ignited weapons. Such
            skill could be obtained only from professional mercenary soldiers in the relatively
            small numbers that could be paid by dynastic monarchies in the mercantilist period. In
            this period this organizational feature of small, professional mercenary armies was
            reinforced by the fact that arms were handmade on a piece-by-piece basis and were thus
            too expensive for the average private citizen to obtain or for the public fisc to
            purchase on a mass basis. Accordingly, it is not surprising that political power
            remained concentrated in a narrow group who controlled this limited supply of weapons
            and did not spread to that majority who were relatively isolated from war and weapons
            and thus had no basis on which to establish any claims for participation in governmental
            functions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This narrow basis for military activity in the sixteenth, seventeenth,
            and eighteenth
            centuries fully sustains the narrow distribution of political power in the same period.
            Accordingly, it became relatively easy for the vested interest groups to defend the
            status quo and to prevent structural changes when the new period of crisis began at the
            end of the seventeenth century.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The second period of expansion in Western civilization was transformed
            into a second
            Age of Conflict when the instrument of expansion became an institution. The two phases
            of this organization are generally called commercial capitalism and state mercantilism.
            The preceding period of mercantilism, which we called municipal mercantilism, generally
            had been regulated by municipal political units rather than by the wider monarchical
            political units of the eighteenth century; it had been dominated by the interests of the
            consumer and had reflected this concern in a \"policy of provision\" that put
            restrictions
            on exports but not on imports, and tried to regulate craft activities to protect
            quality. By 1400 this policy had become very restrictive. The second phase of
            mercantilism was organized on a different basis with different aims, since it was
            generally regulated by dynastic monarchies and generally sought to protect the interests
            of commercial groups. As such, it had no interest in restricting either imports or
            exports, but rather sought to make goods go through the territory so that fees of
            handling and the profits of exchange could be ensured to the citizens. This is
            frequently called \"the policy of the staple,\" and contrasts both with the \"policy of
            provision\" of the first Age of Conflict and with the \"policy of protection\" of the
            third
            Age of Conflict (that associated with monopoly capitalism after 1900). These three
            policies represent the interests of three different aspects of the economic system. Any
            economic system must provide production, distribution, and consumption. Each of the
            three Ages of Conflict of Western civilization sought to protect the vested interests of
            one of these aspects, but in the reverse order so that the consumer was dominant in the
            first period (about 1400), the trader was dominant in the second (about 1750), and the
            producer was dominant in the third (about 1930). Any effort to make means into ends or
            to make one section or aspect of a process the dominant interest of the whole process is
            a clear indication of institutionalization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process of institutionalization can be seen as a kind of general
            stagnation of
            Western civilization during most of the century from 1650 to 1750. The geographic
            expansion that had spread in such a phenomenal way in the period 1450 to 1650 began to
            hesitate. In North America the colonies remained east of the Appalachians or, in some
            areas, below the fall line; in South America the incredible explorations of the earlier
            period, which, for example, had seen the continent crossed from west to east by way of
            the Amazon, were not repeated until the nineteenth century. In the history of Africa we
            find a similar situation. In most areas of the Dark Continent there were widespread
            explorations and missionary activities, even a transcontinental journey, in the
            sixteenth century, but then nothing similar occurred again until the nineteenth century.
            Expansion into India and the Far East shows a similar, but less drastic, hesitancy.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The same cycle can be seen in legislation, which devoted itself, after
            about 1650, to
            the defense of the status quo or to the effort, by political action, to obtain a larger
            share for oneself of what was regarded as a static and unexpandable body of the world\'s
            wealth. This can be seen in the navigation acts that the English colonies in America so
            resented in the period after 1765 but that were first enacted after 1649. These acts
            sought to prevent economic innovations in the colonies and to force their trade and
            commodities to go through England and English hands whatever their ultimate destination.
            At the same time, within England, technical innovation was discouraged, work became an
            end in itself, and laws were made to preserve existing markets as they stood. In a
            semistatistical study, Change and History, published in 1952, Margaret T. Hodgen found
            three periods of technical innovation in Western history. These were the eleventh
            century to the fourteenth century, the sixteenth century, and the nineteenth century.
            Governments did all they could to discourage such innovation in the late seventeenth
            century in contrast to the late sixteenth when they still sought to reward it. In
            England the patent power was used to prevent new techniques rather than to encourage
            them. As early as 1623 the Privy Council ordered destruction of a machine for making
            needles; cloth buttons (rather than bone) were forbidden in 1698, while Indian calico
            was forbidden in 1686. A law of 1666 ordered all persons to be buried in wool rather
            than in the traditional linen. Every effort was made to prevent new techniques in the
            textile industry and thus, in effect, to hamper the growth of cotton textiles. In France
            these efforts culminated in the crafts codes of Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Issued in seven
            volumes of 2,200 pages over the period 1666-1730, these sought to prescribe every detail
            of the established craft techniques and to proscribe innovations in these. Economic aims
            and economic values were distorted and frequently reversed so that consumption was
            condemned as an evil, abundance abhorred, work praised as an end in itself, exporting
            encouraged, and poverty regarded as a good because it was the only way to keep people
            working. The esteemed Sir William Petty (1662) believed that a country could get richer
            and richer by exporting more and more and that it would be a good thing \"if the
            products
            of the labor of a thousand men could be burned\" since these men could then keep their
            skills by having to make the goods over again. Charles Davenant in 1698 wrote. \"By what
            is consumed at home one loseth only what another gets and the nation in general is not
            all the richer, but all foreign consumption is a clear and certain profit.\" More
            briefly
            in 1673 Becker wrote, \"All selling is good, all buying bad,\" while in 1677 John
            Houghton
            drew a logical conclusion from these ideas by suggesting that England could get richer
            by inviting foreigners to come in to \"consume our corn, cattle, cloths, coals, and
            other
            things.\" It was suggested that an enemy in wartime could be greatly weakened if he
            could
            be flooded with goods and, as late as 1810, that last great mercantilist, Napoleon,
            issued licenses to smugglers to carry goods into England secretly. De Mandeville praised
            vice because it was unproductive, while Defoe praised a law forbidding a more efficient
            canalboat able to do the same work with fewer men.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As might be expected in such a period, the century 1650- 1750 was one
            of imperialist
            wars, of class conflicts, of flattening population expansion, of softening prices, and
            of irrational confusions. Of these the class conflicts and imperialist wars continued
            until 1815, although a new Age of Expansion had begun as early as 1730. Napoleon was the
            culmination of this Age of Conflict, seeking to establish a universal empire (and almost
            succeeding in the core area by 1811), seeking to enforce his mercantilist conceptions
            with the full authority of his imperial system, and quite convinced that he was living
            in a limited world in which one share could be increased only if another were curtailed.
            In these wars Napoleon was fighting \"the wave of the future\" with the methods of the
            past. This can be seen quite clearly if we merely look at four or five aspects of the
            new nineteenth century of expansion.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In financial matters one of the great problems of Western civilization
            from the
            earliest period had been fluctuations and, above all, limitations on the volume of
            money. So long as money was in the form of specie there could be no close correlation
            between the volume of money available and the economic need for money as a medium of
            savings and exchange. The volume of money was strictly related to the supply of bullion
            except for minor influences (like hoarding, flows of specie to India and the East, and
            such), but this supply was in no way related to economic needs. We have seen that the
            supply increased too rapidly in the three centuries 1000-1300, then increased far too
            slowly (because of exhaustion of existing mines within the framework of the existing
            technology) for the next century and a half (1300-1450), then was expanded in a
            spectacular and accidental way, quite out of relationship to economic need, by Spanish
            access to the bullion stores of Mexico and Peru (1450-1650), but that the diffusion of
            these stores left the economy of Western civilization on an inflated price level that
            could not be sustained by any continued increase in bullion supplies. Thus, by the late
            seventeenth century and much of the eighteenth century, the flow of bullion was not
            sufficient to satisfy either the demands of an expanding economic system or those of a
            mercantilist political system supported by a mercenary military system. This inadequacy
            began to be remedied at the very end of the seventeenth century, notably by the
            establishment of the Bank of England in 1694. This remedy rested on the use of banknotes
            backed to only a fractional part of their value by specie reserves. This was a partial
            solution of the problem of money for two reasons: (1) it permitted a great increase in
            the volume of money when the supply of bullion was increasingly inadequate and (2) it
            permitted the volume of money to fluctuate to some extent in response to changing needs
            for money in the economy.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This new technique of monetary manipulation became one of the basic
            factors in the
            great Age of Expansion in the nineteenth century and made the fluctuations of economic
            activity less responsive to the rate of bullion production from mines, by making it more
            responsive to new factors reflecting the demand for money (such as the interest rate).
            This new technique spread relatively slowly in the century between the founding of the
            Bank of England and Napoleon\'s creation of the Bank of France in 1803. The Napoleonic
            Wars, because of the backward, specie-based, financial ideas of Napoleon were, on their
            fiscal side, a struggle between the older, bullionist, obsolete system favored by
            Napoleon and the new fractional-reserve banknote system of England.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A similar situation existed in regard to food production. No very
            impressive economic
            expansion was possible in the eighteenth century without some new agricultural
            techniques capable of increasing the output of food. No such increase could be expected
            so long as the medieval three-field system with its unenclosed scattered strips and free
            ranging farm animals continued. This medieval system had been a great success in its
            day, greatly superior to the old classical two-field, slave system, and capable of
            supporting the new Western civilization through its first two Ages of Expansion, but by
            1650 its output per man-day of work was not sufficient to support any notable increase
            of the proportion of the population in crafts and trade, and it was, of course, quite
            incapable of providing the food or raw materials for industrialism.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This medieval organization of agriculture was fully institutionalized
            by 1650 and had
            become a great obstacle to continued expansion. Just at that point, however, there
            became available in western Europe the elements of a new agrarian system fully capable
            of supporting a new period of expansion and destined to do so in the nineteenth century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The new organization of agriculture is usually known as the
            agricultural revolution.
            In essence it abandoned the three-field system for a leguminous-rotation system in which
            a leguminous crop was put in place of the fallow stage in the older three-stage cycle.
            Such a leguminous crop (like alfalfa or clover) put much more nitrogen in the field than
            any fallow year ever could, but it required a major reorganization in livestock
            handling. Animals had to be fenced in rather than fenced out of the arable field as in
            the older system, because the fallow and, to a lesser degree, the stubble, on which
            medieval livestock had foraged, were gone. Fencing in of animals (or enclosure) had
            three important results: (1) selective breeding could be practiced, with a great
            improvement in the quality of farm animals; (2) animal manure was now available in
            quantity to be used where its fertility was most needed; and (3) feed had to be supplied
            to the animals, thus providing a use for the leguminous crop that had been put into the
            fallow stage of the older cycle. There was thus a drastic increase in size, quality, and
            numbers of farm animals as a consequence of the agricultural revolution. As an index of
            this we might note that the slaughter weights of farm animals tripled at Smithfield
            Market in England during the eighty-five-year period ending in 1795.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The agricultural revolution did not cease with the factors we have
            mentioned, but
            included a number of other significant items. Enclosure ejected a considerable number of
            subsistence peasants from the agrarian system and led to larger holdings and some degree
            of rural depopulation, thus providing manpower for increased commerce and industry. It
            also made possible numerous other technical advances, many of them associated with the
            ideas of rural eccentrics like Jethro Tull (1711). These included planting of seed in
            rows, in holes in the ground, by use of a seed drill instead of broadcast surface sowing
            as in the Middle Ages. This encouraged seed selection and the use of horse-drawn
            cultivators.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The agricultural revolution was the basis of the new Age of Expansion
            that began in
            England about 1730 but that had not yet reached France a generation later. This fact was
            perfectly clear to Arthur Young when he travelled in France just before the French
            Revolution. As a consequence the Napoleonic Wars were, from this point of view, a
            conflict between the older three-field fallow system and the newer enclosed leguminous
            rotation systems (frequently called, in France and elsewhere, the \"Norfolk System\").
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There was also a third important element in this situation. This was
            the shift from a
            craft system of manufacture to an industrial system. The vital point about this shift is
            not so much the growth of the factory system or the growth of an urban proletariat that
            did not own the tools it used, as the shift from an economy in which production was
            achieved by energy released in living bodies (man- or animal-power) to one in which
            production was achieved by energy released through non-living mechanisms (water power or
            steam engines). This shift, which permitted great increases in production of
            manufactured goods, would never have been possible without the agricultural revolution
            that preceded it and possibly without the advent of a fractional-reserve banking system
            as well. The change, which is usually called the Industrial Revolution, was in full
            development in England but was largely unknown in France during the Napoleonic Wars. In
            this regard, also, these wars represented a conflict between a newer organization for
            fulfilling human desires and an older, obsolescent one.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There is a fourth way in which the Napoleonic Wars represented a
            struggle between the
            new and the old. On the Napoleonic side we find ranged all the forces of mercantilism,
            meaning the theories and the vested-interest forces that believed that economic life had
            to be regulated by the government and regulated for largely political ends. This system
            played a very significant role in Western civilization in the period 1200-1800, but by
            the latter date it was clearly obsolete, and had to be replaced by a more advanced
            system. This newer system of economic management is known as laissez-faire and, as is
            well known, it was associated with the period of expansion of the nineteenth century.
            What is not so well known, however, is what the shift from one to another really
            entailed.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Every economic system has to be regulated. That is, somehow, decisions
            must be made as
            to what is produced, how much of it, and who gets it. In the early Middle Ages and again
            in the late nineteenth century, the European system of management was an unregulated,
            automatic one. That is, no centralized decision making occurred in either. But the two
            were entirely dissimilar in the ways that this came about. In the medieval system,
            economic regulation was automatic through medieval custom: what was produced, how much,
            and who got it were established on the basis of what had been done at an earlier date.
            Custom ruled.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the nineteenth century, once again, Europe had an automatic
            management of economic
            life, but now it was a dynamic economic system, not the static one of the earlier Middle
            Ages, and, as a dynamic system, it could not be regulated by custom. Instead, it was
            regulated by the market. The market is a place where buyers and sellers come together to
            exchange their goods. In an automatic laissez-faire market numerous sellers compete with
            each other, thus forcing prices downward, while simultaneously numerous buyers compete
            with each other, thus forcing prices upward, and, finally, during all this, buyers
            \"higgle\" with sellers. As a consequence of these three forces operating in the market,
            a
            price is reached at which goods are exchanged for money in terms that will clear the
            market of both.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Such a market mechanism is fully capable, as we all know, of
            determining, without
            centralized control, what will be produced, how much will be made, and who will get it.
            But no laissez-faire system can do this unless a market exists, and no such market can
            exist unless both transportation and communications are so highly developed and so free
            that people know what is going on and both goods and money are free to move where each
            is more valuable. Neither transportation nor communications were adequate to this
            purpose when the customary system of the static medieval economy began to break down
            from the introduction of dynamic economic influences about the year 1000. Thus there was
            no market in the year 1000, and there was still no market, although a myriad of small
            markets, in 1700. These small markets existed from the inadequacy of both transportation
            and communication, and were \"small\" in the sense that the numbers of buyers and the
            numbers of sellers in each market were too small to prevent monopolistic or
            oligopolistic prices and to achieve competitive prices. To prevent this and to protect
            the consumer from exploitation, municipal mercantilism grew up and dominated economic
            regulation during the period 1200-1500 approximately.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As improvements in transportation and communications appeared in the
            period of
            medieval expansion, there was a tendency for the numerous small markets regulated by
            municipal mercantilism to flow together to create fewer and larger markets. These larger
            markets, drawing from areas larger than the areas of municipal control and similarly
            supplying goods to larger areas, could not be controlled by municipal authorities.
            Still, these authorities continued to attempt to do what was technically beyond their
            powers to do. These efforts, aiming at the defense of established vested interests
            rather than at the protection of consumers as originally intended, are part of the
            institutionalized structure of the first Age of Conflict.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a consequence of the inability of municipal authorities to regulate
            the newer,
            larger markets created by improved transportation and communications, this task was
            taken over by the emerging dynastic monarchies. We have already shown how changes in
            weapons, political organization, and political ideology had created these newer
            political structures with power to regulate economic life over larger areas. This newer
            economic regulation by dynastic monarchies is known as state mercantilism. It aimed to
            protect traders rather than consumers or producers. Much of the expansion of the second
            period of expansion arose from its efforts.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;By the eighteenth century, state mercantilism had be come in its turn
            a structure of
            vested interests serving to hamper economic life rather than to help it. This was as
            true of traders as it was of consumers and producers. This shift of state mercantilism
            from an instrument to an institution was based on two chief features. On one hand the
            organization was no longer used for an economic purpose but had become an end in itself
            with largely political purposes. It was used to increase state power rather than for
            economic life. On the other hand, by the late eighteenth century, transportation and
            communication were again beginning to improve so rapidly that continental and even world
            markets were coming into existence. These were, of course, much wider than the areas of
            power of the dynastic monarchies and, accordingly, could not be controlled by them. The
            continued efforts of governments to exercise such control in the portions of markets
            that fell in their respective power areas merely served to create restrictions on
            economic life and hampered production, exchange, and consumption alike. This situation
            was shown by Adam Smith in his book The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Clearly markets were
            now large enough to be regulated by supply and demand, by competition and higgling, and
            any movement to allow this would be economically progressive. From this point of view,
            also, the Napoleonic Wars represented a struggle between an older and a younger system.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus from four points of view concerned with finance, agriculture,
            manufacturing, and
            economic regulation, the political struggles between England and France in the
            Napoleonic period reflect a contest between the future and the past. There are, of
            course, numerous other factors involved in this contrast. Some of these will be
            mentioned in the next section, but these four should be sufficient to show that Napoleon
            represented an outmoded system and that he was the last phase of a fairly typical Age of
            Conflict.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The other marks of such an Age of Conflict, with one notable
            exception, are fairly
            obvious or have been mentioned already. The exception is in intellectual history, where
            an Age of Conflict usually is a period of irrationality. This is, of course, not a term
            that could be applied to the eighteenth century where the more usual label (at least for
            the generation 1730-90) is \"Enlightenment.\" This discrepancy is but one indication of
            a
            situation that is far too complex to be discussed here; namely, that the periodization
            of intellectual history is quite different from the periodization of other aspects of
            society. In these other aspects we can distinguish five successive stages on each level
            over the period from A.D. 950 into the future, but on the intellectual level, as shown
            on the next slide, we have at least nine stages over the same time. To some extent this
            can be explained by cultural lag, but there are other influences quite as significant,
            including the much weaker degree of integration between one theory and another, even at
            the same time, or between a theory and any other aspect of the society, than exists
            between the more concrete aspects of culture.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At any period it is possible for a thinker either to accept a theory
            which is
            morphologically compatible with his age or to reject it. In such cases the ideology of
            the age must be sought in the generally unstated assumptions made both by conformists
            and nonconformists. In the eighteenth century the Enlightenment was nonconformist to the
            other levels of the society, and this is, indeed, one of the chief causes of the French
            Revolution. The rational, orderly, organized qualities of the Enlightenment were quite
            incompatible with the irrational, disorderly, and disorganized society of the day, and
            thus gave rise to tensions that, reinforced from other directions, provided the energy
            motivating the French Revolution. The irrationality to be associated with the second Age
            of Conflict might be sought either in the intellectual stage that preceded the
            Enlightenment or with the romantic movement that followed it. In the former case it
            would be associated with such items as the political theory of Hobbes and with
            Jansenism, while in the latter case it would be associated with the literary movements
            that began with Richardson or Macpherson\'s Ossian and developed into Rousseau, Sturm
            und
            Drang, Wordsworth, and others, or with the political theories of men like Burke, Fichte,
            Bonald, or DeMaistre, and the religious movements represented by Methodism. On the
            whole, it seems preferable, without being dogmatic, to associate the latter intellectual
            stage with the irrationalism we expect from an Age of Conflict. But, at any rate, the
            subject is too complicated to be discussed in any satisfactory way here.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The third Age of Expansion lasted from about 1730 to about 1929,
            although indications
            of a new Age of Conflict began to appear as early as 1890. Its instrument of expansion
            remained capitalistic, but operating in fields other than those that had become
            institutionalized in the earlier Age of Conflict of the late seventeenth century. The
            reappearance of expansion clearly resulted from circumvention of this previous
            organization. Again the period of expansion can be divided into substages that make the
            process of expansion appear as a series of steps or surges. We might list these steps as
            follows: (1) the agricultural revolution from 1730; (2) the Industrial Revolution from
            1770; (3) financial capitalism from 1850; and (4) monopoly capitalism from 1900.
            Naturally the dates listed are very rough, because the advent of these steps is quite
            different in various areas. We have already indicated the nature of the agricultural
            revolution as a reform of the institutionalized medieval three-field fallow system. Its
            roots go back many generations, but it began to operate as a significant, expansive
            force in England about 1730. It is, of course, one of the most important events in

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Two revolutionary events of the later eighteenth century contributed a
            good deal
            toward the new Age of Expansion. These were the transportation revolution, which began
            about 1750, and the population revolution, which began about a generation later. The
            transportation revolution consisted of a series of innovations that provided (a) an
            effective traveling coach; (b) hard-surfaced, all-weather roads; (c) canals; (d)
            telegraphic communication; and (e) railroads. All these appeared in the century
            1750-1850. In the following century the revolution in transportation and communciations
            continued with the advent of (f) high-speed printing presses; (g) the
            internal-combustion engine, leading to automobiles and airplanes; and (h) electricity,
            leading to radio, the motion picture, and television.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The population revolution began about 1780 with the use of vaccination
            for smallpox.
            It continued with the discovery of germ infection and the invention of antiseptics by
            Pasteur and Lister, as well as improvements in surgery such as the discovery of ether.
            Advances of this kind have continued with accelerating rapidity and have given rise to a
            population \"explosion\" resulting from a drastic reduction in death rates far sharper
            than the slight decreases in birth rates. The transportation and population revolutions
            occurred most conveniently between the agricultural and Industrial revolutions in
            Western civilization, each of the four providing a sound basis for the next. This was
            quite different from the experience of the non-Western world where these, and other,
            revolutionary advances diffused in a quite different sequence that was far better fitted
            to raising problems than to solving them.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Industrial Revolution, which we have defined as production by
            energy coming
            through non-living mechanisms (that is, from water power or steam rather than from men
            or animals), is familiar to all of us. Accordingly, we shall refer only to certain
            organizational features that help to distinguish its early period of owner-management
            from its second period of financial capitalism. In the former the typical pattern of
            organization was the private firm or partnership with both capital and decision making
            supplied by the owners. In the latter the typical form of organization was the
            limited-liability corporation and the holding company, in which capital came from the
            owners but decision making came from the management. As is well known, the Industrial
            Revolution first flourished in textiles using either water power or steam engines. Even
            when it spread into mining and ironmaking, the older form of proprietorship or
            partnership continued to prevail. But gradually it spread into the activities of the
            still-expanding transportation revolution. There, in canal building and, above all, in
            railroad building, it became impossible to continue to use the partnership form of
            business organization because the needs for capital were far greater than could be
            satisfied by the savings of any group of partners. The corporate form of enterprise was
            adopted for these activities because it could mobilize the savings of many in the
            control of a few and do so with limited liability for the many. First used on a large
            scale in railroads, it soon spread into coal mining, ironmaking, and machine building.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This change led to the period of financial capitalism that began about
            1850 and died a
            violent death about September 1931 with the collapse of the international gold standard.
            As the period developed, the need for capital by corporations became so great that
            specialized capital-raising organizations appeared. These investment bankers, in return
            for their services, obtained representation on the boards of directors of corporations
            and sufficient influence to direct their companies\' financial services and purchases
            toward other corporations where the particular investment bankers concerned had
            interests. From this there grew up a network of interlocking directorships and banking
            influences and, finally, an elaborate system of holding companies and financial firms.
            These growing monopolistic influences were centralized by the joint concern which all
            financiers had in keeping the value of money high (or \"stabilized,\" as they called
            it).
            This joint concern was reflected in the appearance of a joint organization, the central
            bank, which held the gold reserves that became the central feature of the monetary
            system. The international gold standard became the chief mechanism by which the supply
            of money could be kept low and its value, accordingly, kept high. A high value of money,
            which implies a low supply of money, was chiefly advantageous to creditors, to whom
            obligations were owed in money terms. But such a high value of money clearly meant low
            prices of goods, and was a disadvantage to debtors and to manufacturers of goods.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus there appeared a dichotomy between bankers and industrialists,
            with one eager for
            a high value of money and high interests rates, while the other was eager for high
            prices of goods (thus low value of money) and low interest rates. For a long time the
            dichotomy between the two did not come into the open because bankers succeeded in
            befuddling industrialists on financial matters, presenting them as abstruse subjects in
            which the industrialist\'s wisest course would be to follow his banker\'s advice. As
            long
            as the industrialist was dependent upon the banker for capital, he had to use that
            advice, even when he sometimes suspected that the interests of the two were not
            identical. But few industrialists before Henry Ford even realized that the interests of
            bankers and industrialists were opposed.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This opposition of interests between the two appeared most clearly
            when there was an
            insufficient supply of money for the growing industrial structure. This insufficient
            supply of money was based on the insufficient supply of gold, since the bankers
            controlled the supply of money through the mechanism of the gold standard. The bankers
            called the use of the gold standard \"stabilization,\" and insisted that it provided a
            stable value to money; it did no such thing, but rather provided stable foreign
            exchanges (for all currencies based on gold) and a growing value to money. The growing
            value to money on the gold standard occurred because the supply of money could not
            increase as rapidly as the supply of goods when the former was based on output of the
            world\'s gold mines and the latter was based on the much more expandable industrial
            system. Accordingly, the overall tendency was for prices to soften during the whole
            period 1770-1931 except when there were sudden increases in the world\'s gold supplies
            (notably in 1848-52 and 1896- 1904) or when political events, such as wars, made it
            necessary to suspend the gold standard or to destroy quantities of goods, as in
            1792-1815, 1861-72 and 1914-19. Outside these exceptional events, the general tendency
            of the price history of the third Age of Expansion was deflationary (as was evident in
            1816-48, 1872-96, 1920-33). This tendency led, in each deflationary substage, to growing
            depression and to increasing agrarian and labor unrest associated with such historic
            labels as the \"hungry forties,\" the \"Populist movement,\" and the \"great world
            depression.\" The tendency generally benefited bankers and injured industry by
            increasing
            the value of money and the costs of credit and making profitable industrial operations
            more difficult (since falling prices force businessmen to incur costs on an earlier and
            higher price level than that on which they must subsequently offer their product for
            sale). In these deflationary periods, as low prices drove corporations to bankruptcy,
            bankers were able to assume control of them, to consolidate them into larger units of
            monopolized industry, and to reap the profits of reorganization and refloatation of
            securities. Although industrialists and businessmen generally accepted the bankers\'
            justifications of these events, debtors (especially farmers) and workers (who suffered
            unemployment) were increasingly resentful. The first deflationary period, leading to the
            disturbances of the late 1840s, and the second, leading to the disturbances of the early
            1890s, were both ended by the discovery of new gold supplies, in California and
            Australia in 1848-50 and in South Africa and the Klondike in 1897-1900. In addition, the
            supply of gold, in the second case, was increased by new methods of extracting gold from
            its ores. But none of these occurred in the third deflationary period, 1919-31, and
            financial capitalism, long threatened by its own creation, monopoly capitalism, perished
            in 1931— 33. As a consequence, the domination of economic life by financial figures,
            such as Rothschild, Morgan, Mirabaud, Baring, Montagu Norman, or even Ivar Kreuger, was
            ended and replaced by great figures of monopoly capitalism like DuPont, Melchett,
            Leverhulme, Rockefeller, Ford, Nuffield, and others. In this connection, however, it
            should be pointed out that the typical figure of monopoly capitalism is not the
            individual \"captain of industry\" of the earlier period but the anonymously managed
            superfirm like United Shoe Machinery, I. G. Farbenindustrie, Unilever, DuPont Chemicals,
            Hartford-Empire, Alcoa, Volkswagen, Pecheney, General Motors, General Electric, or
            General Dynamics. It should also be noted that the generally deflationary character of
            the nineteenth century had certain beneficial aspects, such as wider distribution of
            goods at lower prices and, above all, the drastic need to lower costs of production by
            greater productive efficiency in order to ensure continued profits in a soft-price era.
            These two aspects of the period explain why the nineteenth century remained an Age of
            Expansion in spite of its adjustment difficulties.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is not necessary to point out that the general characteristics we
            have posited for
            an Age of Expansion were in full flower during the nineteenth century. Geographic
            expansion was resumed so that Africa, the polar regions, the Matto Grosso, and New
            Guinea became familiar areas; population soared; production increased, even in periods
            of falling prices; knowledge expanded beyond any one person\'s comprehension; even
            democracy and science reached their greatest victories. Indeed, the nineteenth century
            in terms of our description of an Age of Expansion could be the Age of Expansion par
            excellence.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the military and political levels the third Age of Expansion was
            associated with
            such familiar historical developments as the mass citizen army, the national state, and
            democracy. The shift to these from the older stages of these levels generally occurred
            during the era of the French Revolution and Napoleon. The reasons for these changes
            should be examined because, while often mentioned, they are rarely analyzed.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The second Age of Conflict had been associated with the professional
            mercenary army,
            the dynastic monarchy, and authoritarian government. On the economic and social levels
            it had been associated with mercantilism and the supremacy of the bureaucracy. As is
            well known, these last two stages were replaced, on their respective levels, by
            laissez-faire and the bourgeoisie in the nineteenth century. Any analysis of the process
            that gave rise to these extensive changes on all levels of culture might well begin with
            the military situation.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the second Age of Conflict the best available weapons in Western
            civilization were
            artillery, muskets, and pikes (or bayonets). These were difficult to use and usually
            expensive to obtain. As a result they could be used only by trained men and could be
            bought only by a relatively well-to- do entity. Such trained men had to be professional
            users of weapons, and the weapons had to be provided by the state or by the wealthy. All
            of this taken together meant that weapons were available only to a small minority of the
            population and that the majority must expect, as a general rule, to yield to the
            authority of the minority that controlled these weapons. Thus it followed, almost as a
            matter of course, that the political level had to be authoritarian. The organization of
            that authority into a dynastic monarchy was a consequence of the governmental traditions
            of Europe. As the system operated, it was expected that allegiance and loyalty would be
            given to the family of the ruling monarch, in order to assure succession to his heir.
            This loyalty was not really expected from all persons, but only from the significant
            ones —the clergy, the nobility, the chief bourgeoisie, and all guild members and
            possibly from well-to-do independent peasantry, but the ordinary peasantry and the guild
            apprentices, as persons of little significance, were not subjects of much concern about
            their allegiance of loyalty. The operation of mercantilism and the social superiority of
            the royal bureaucracy were also dependent, if less directly, on the organization and
            control of the military level. Thus the structure of all four levels (military,
            political, economic control, and social) was based on the military organization of
            professional mercenary soldiers.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the age of Napoleon and just after it, this military organization
            was modified
            greatly into a quite new system that survived for over a century. This innovation was
            the mass citizen army fighting for patriotism rather than for pay. The new organization
            was made possible by a series of innovations in weapons and tactics, and in military, as
            well as political, organization. In weapons the arrival of the Industrial Revolution and
            of mass-produced firearms based on interchangeable parts lowered the cost of weapons at
            the same time that the general economic expansion was raising standards of living. These
            two intersecting factors made it possible for the average man, in areas where these
            factors were operating, to obtain guns at a cost that he could afford to pay (that is,
            no more than his earning power over a few weeks). These guns were becoming easier to use
            by the shift from spark ignition to percussion ignition and breech-loading. All these
            innovations made it possible to arm large masses of men at relatively low cost. At the
            same time the shift to such a mass army was made possible by changes in political
            organization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The political organization that we have called dynastic monarchy could
            continue only
            so long as the best weapon available in the society could be obtained only by a
            minority. As soon as a majority could obtain the best available weapon and use it with
            little training, it became impossible for any minority to enforce obedience on a
            majority and, accordingly, the authoritarian structure of political life began to
            crumble. A reorganization of political life became necessary.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This reorganization of the political structure had a double aspect. On
            the one hand it
            became necessary to shift from minority rule to majority rule, and on the other hand it
            became necessary to find a new political organization that could place its appeal to
            allegiance on a basis that could be used for the majority of the society. This new basis
            was nationalism, and the new organization, which succeeded the dynastic state in the
            early nineteenth century, is known as the national state (prevalent from about 1800 to
            about 1950).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The political shift from dynastic monarchy to national state and the
            shift in weapons
            from a professional mercenary army to a mass army of citizens allowed the cost of a
            man\'s service to be reduced (since he fought for patriotism instead of for money) and
            permitted a great change in military tactics (since patriotic men were more willing to
            die than were mercenary soldiers). The older tactics of the dynastic monarchs had
            favored wars of manoeuvre with limited forces for limited aims. By \"wars of manoeuvre\"
            we mean tactics in which enemy forces were dislodged from their positions by cutting
            their communications and supplies rather than by assault, with battles occurring only
            rarely and chiefly from accidental collisions during shifts of position. Such wars were
            long drawn out, with few battles, and could be ended at any time by negotiation because
            of the possibility of compromising the combatants\' limited and concrete goals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The advent of patriotic mass armies made it possible to force the
            enemy from his
            position by assault rather than by manoeuvre. The new tactics, worked out by Napoleon in
            the period 1795-1815, organized this assault in three steps: artillery barrage, bayonet
            attack by infantry, and cavalry pursuit. All three steps were innovations, but the
            greatest change was in the second where the bayonet was entirely transformed from its
            earlier role as a defensive weapon against cavalry to an offensive weapon against
            opposing infantry. It was the nature of this second, and central, step in the new
            tactics that made necessary the innovations in the use of artillery and cavalry in the
            two other steps.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The possibility of heavy casualties in the second step of the new
            tactics, in which
            bayonets were sent against firepower, made it necessary to obtain very high morale from
            citizen soldiers. This high morale could not be obtained so long as the aims of war
            remained, as in the earlier period, limited and concrete; they had to be made unlimited
            and idealistic (\"saving the revolution\" or \"civilization,\" \"making the world safe
            for
            democracy,\" \"freedom of the seas,\" \"rights of small nations,\" and similar
            unobtainable
            abstractions). Such goals could not be compromised, and, accordingly, battles had to
            become conflicts of annihilation in which the survival of the contending regimes was at
            stake. Such battles of annihilation led to a series of brief \"one battle\" wars such as
            the French-Austrian War of 1859, the Prussian-Austrian War of 1866, the Franco-Prussian
            War of 1870, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, and the Spanish- American War of 1899. Even
            as this pattern was being established, however, new forces were arising that laid the
            basis for quite a different pattern in the twentieth century. These new forces were (1)
            the growing importance of ideological forces, which made it less likely that a people
            would accept the consequences of death in a single battle, and (2) the growing strength
            of the tactical defensive, which made it less necessary to yield to such a defeat in one
            battle. The growing ideological influence was clearly evident in the American Civil War,
            the struggle with the French guerrillas, and the Paris Commune after Sedan in 1871, the
            Boer War of 1899-1902 and, above all, World War I. The growing importance of the
            defensive made the second step of a Napoleonic battle, the bayonet offensive, less and
            less likely to be decisive and made it less and less possible that the outcome of the
            battle itself could be decisive. The growing strength of the defensive rested on the
            rapid growth of firepower after the invention of the machine gun about 1862 (this made
            both bayonet and cavalry obsolete), the increasing use of field fortifications (this
            reduced the effectiveness of both artillery barrage and of offensive firepower), the
            invention of barbed wire about 1879 (this hampered the infantry charge of the second
            step and the cavalry pursuit of the third), and of the airplane in 1903 (this took from
            the cavalry its only surviving role as reconnaissance). The tactical changes made
            necessary by these innovations were not recognized by military men until after they had
            inflicted the almost unbearable casualties of 1916-17, but these changes (such as use of
            tanks, infiltration, aerial bombardment, and the like) made weapons once again so
            expensive and so difficult to use that it became increasingly needful to replace the
            mass citizen army by an army of specialists. Such a change, by reserving instruments of
            force to a minority, reversed the trend on the political level to a new development from
            democracy toward authoritarian government. The date of this reversal might be fixed in
            1934, the year that the German general Guderian read de Gaulle\'s book Army of
            Specialists. At the same time it became clear that rapid improvements in weapons,
            communications (radio), transportation (trucks), and organization made it possible to
            enforce obedience to orders over geographic distances far greater than those covered by
            any national groups. Accordingly, appeal to political allegiance on nationality grounds
            became obsolete and it became necessary to make such an appeal on some much wider basis.
            The new basis, now in process of being discovered was common ideological outlook.
            Accordingly the stage of the national state began to be replaced by the stage of the
            ideological state (or bloc) on the level of political organization, and the area covered
            by a single political unit widened from the nation to the Continental bloc. The
            inability of Hitler to make such a shift from a nationalist to an ideological (or other
            wider) basis at a time when his factual power was so much wider geographically than the
            area of Germanism was but one of his fatal errors.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This change has been recognized in popular discussion and carried,
            perhaps, to a
            degree not justified by the actual facts. We are told that we now live in a \"two-power
            world,\" although the power of the United States and of the Soviet Union is not in fact
            hemispherical. Each of these superpowers can, it is true, obtain obedience in most
            matters over about forty percent of the earth\'s surface, but this leaves a buffer area
            between, amounting to about a fifth of the earth. This \"buffer fringe\" lying between
            the
            Soviet \"heartland\" and the peripheral, and ocean-linked, Western civilization is
            occupied by the shattered remnants of dying civilizations or the hopeful efforts of
            incipient new civilizations. The hope of the future does not rest, as commonly believed,
            in winning the peoples of the \"buffer fringe\" to one superpower or the other, but
            rather
            in the invention of new weapons and new tactics that will be so cheap to obtain and so
            easy to use that they will increase the effectiveness of guerrilla warfare so greatly
            that the employment of our present weapons of mass destruction will become futile and,
            on this basis, there can be a revival of democracy and of political decentralization in
            all three parts of our present world. This possible development in military and
            political matters would, of course, require the development of decentralized economic
            techniques such as could arise if sunlight became the chief energy source for production
            and the advance of science made it possible to manufacture any desired substance by
            molecular rearrangement of such common materials as sea water, plant fibers, and
            ordinary earth.

            its close at the
            end of the nineteenth century. By 1890 the rate of general expansion had begun to
            decrease, giving rise to acute crises in industry, agriculture, labor relations,
            political action, and international relations. These crises culminated in the beginnings
            of a new, third Age of Conflict in Western civilization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The third Age of Conflict of our society began to display the ordinary
            marks of such a
            stage about 1890. At that time, in the principal industrial countries it became clear
            that the rate of expansion had reversed itself. This led to a frenzied effort by
            businessmen to organize in cartels and trade associations in order to keep prices above
            competitive levels and to share shrinking markets rather than to compete, as formerly,
            for new ones. Along with this went loud demands for tariff protection and all kinds of
            restrictive agreements, tacit or explicit, restricting new investment or entry of new
            enterprises into an activity. Increased pressure was put on governments to favor
            industrialists, and business organizations were formed to fight labor demands for any
            larger share of the goods being produced.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the same time, labor and agriculture were reacting in a similar
            fashion, forming
            political pressure groups or even political parties, and seeking common action to raise
            prices, divide markets, exclude foreign competition, and to strike back at organized
            industry, finance, or transportation.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;While these activities were occurring as symptoms for the usual
            decline in the rate of
            expansion and of the growing class conflicts associated with an Age of Conflict, the
            other marks of such a period were no less obvious. Imperialist wars developed from
            epidemic to endemic status in our culture, beginning perhaps with the Boer War and the
            Spanish-American War, but rapidly expanding into a cycle of international stress and
            crises in which we still live. At the same time, on the intellectual level occurred a
            great upsurging of irrationality. This latter development is associated with the eager
            acceptance of the theories of men like Freud, Bergson, or Sorel, and culminated in the
            utterly irrational activism of Hitler, Mussolini, and many lesser persons. All the
            characteristics of an age of irrationality began to appear on all sides—increased
            gambling, increased smoking, the growing use of alcohol and narcotics, a growing
            obsession with sex and with perversions of sex, an increasing mania for speed, for
            nervous tension, and for noise; above all, perhaps, a growing tendency to regard
            violence as a solution for all problems, be they domestic, social, economic,
            ideological, or international. In fact, violence as a symbol of our growing
            irrationality has had an increasing role in activity for its own sake, when no possible
            justification could be made that the activity was seeking to solve a problem.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;All these characteristics of any Age of Conflict are too obvious to
            require further
            comment. They arose, as is usual in an Age of Conflict, because the organizational
            patterns of our culture ceased to function as instruments but had become
            institutionalized. This process was evident on all levels of culture. Religious
            organizations no longer linked men to God but adopted diverse mundane purposes. Our
            intellectual theories no longer explained anything or made us at home in the universe.
            Our social patterns no longer satisfied our gregarious needs, even when we fled from the
            lonely anonymity of the city to the rat-race uniformity of suburbanism. Our political
            organizations increased the burden of their demands on our time, energy, and wealth but
            provided with growing ineffectiveness the justice, public order, education, protection,
            or incidental amenities we had come to expect from them. And, on the military level,
            costs rose at an astronomical rate without being able to catch up with our increasing
            danger.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The core of our problems could be placed in any one of the levels we
            have mentioned.
            Indeed, there might be good grounds for arguing that the root of our problem was our
            success in making life an end rather than a means to something higher. But, in this
            civilization as in others, it will be convenient to discuss the problem of our Age of
            Conflict in terms of the institutionalization of our instrument of expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In an earlier chapter we discussed this phenomenon as an example of
            the process in
            general (chapter five). At that time we said that the economic organization had become
            institutionalized by taking on purposes of its own separate from the purposes of the
            organization as a whole. The purpose of any economic system is to produce, distribute,
            and consume goods. If it can do this at an increasing rate (within limits), so much the
            better. Our economic system performed these functions more effectively than any other in
            history by organizing itself around \"a profit motivation within a price structure.\" As
            it became institutionalized, profits became an end in themselves to the jeopardy of
            production, distribution, and consumption. The change arose because profits could be
            maximized only by increasing the margin between selling prices and costs of production.
            But high selling prices and high profit margins with low costs of production tended to
            reduce consumption of goods. And low consumption of goods, at a time when production
            figures were constantly setting new maximum records, could only result in rising
            inventories and an indigestion of distribution that was bound to make goods back up to
            the factories to smother production.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This situation arose from a number of factors. During the nineteenth
            century,
            production had been emphasized in such a way as to distort the economic system as a
            whole, since such a system must also include distribution and consumption. Moreover,
            within the productive system the pursuit of profits had been emphasized to the neglect
            of any of the other necessary parts of the productive process. Put briefly, profits had
            become an end rather than a means. One consequence of this failure in coordination of
            the economic system as a whole and the even greater failure to coordinate the economic
            system in the civilization as a whole had been the growth of a very inequitable
            distribution of the wealth produced by the economic system. Such an inequitable
            distribution of wealth was a very excellent thing as long as lack of capital was
            prevalent in the economic system, but such a maldistribution of income ceases to be an
            advantage as soon as the productive system has developed out of all proportion to the
            processes of distribution and of consumption. In the United States, according to the
            National Industrial Conference Board, the richest one-fifth of our population received
            46.2 percent of the national income in 1910, 51.3 percent of it in 1929, and 48.5
            percent in 1937. In the same three years, the share of the poorest one-fifth of the
            population fell from 8.3 percent to 5.4 percent to 3.6 percent. Thus the ratios between
            the portion obtained by the richest one-fifth and that obtained by the poorest one-fifth
            increased in the three years mentioned from 5.6 to 9.3 to 13.5. If, instead of
            one-fifth, we examine the ratios between the percentage obtained by the richest
            one-tenth and the poorest one-tenth in the same three years we find that this ratio was
            10 in 1910, was 21.7 in 1929, and reached 34.4 in 1937. To some extent this situation
            was made worse by the growing separation, in the more advanced industrial areas, between
            ownership and control of corporations, since this led to an increased accumulation of
            undistributed profits held by the corporations in control of the management rather than
            distributed as dividends to the owners. Such undistributed profits became savings with
            no possibility of serving as consumer purchasing power.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These factors and a number of others that we have not space to mention
            here led to a
            situation where increasing proportions of the national income were going to those
            persons in the community who would be likely to save and decreasing proportions were
            going to those persons in the community who would spend their incomes for consumers\'
            goods. This situation could continue as long as all the savings made by the former group
            were invested in new capital or otherwise spent, because these actions would distribute
            such savings to persons who would use their incomes to buy goods. Only under these
            conditions (that all savings be invested or spent) could all goods produced be sold.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The last statement can be expressed in a simple arithmetical
            relationship. In any
            single firm the total selling price of the goods produced is equal to the sum of their
            costs of production and their profits. In the economic community as a whole the
            aggregation of the selling prices of all firms will be the sum of aggregate costs plus
            aggregate profits. The incomes of the community as a whole are the same as the aggregate
            of the selling prices of all goods because the profits and costs of each firm are the
            incomes of those to whom they are paid. If savings are held back from these incomes, the
            purchasing power available to purchase the goods being offered for sale will be reduced
            below the prices being asked.
            Thus:
            Total prices = total costs + profits
            Total incomes = total costs + profits
            Therefore,
            Total prices = total incomes

            But available purchasing power = incomes — savings + investment. Accordingly, the
            purchasing power available to buy the goods being offered at the prices being asked will
            be inadequate unless all savings are invested.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;During the world depression of 1929-38 all savings were not invested
            because there was
            no point in spending money on new capital plant so long as the goods being produced by
            the existing capital plant were going unsold because of the inequitable flow of incomes
            into the control of persons who wished to save rather than into the control of those who
            wished to consume.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This crisis of the system was intensified by a number of other
            factors, notably the
            deflationary influence of a monetary system tied to a limited supply of gold under
            conditions of power production of goods. As a consequence the crisis was accompanied by
            a drastic price deflation that eventually led to a banking crisis and the end of the
            international gold standard. The date of this last event could be fixed at September 21,
            1931, when sterling, which had been the center of the whole world\'s financial network
            for more than a century, went off gold. Succinctly, the banking crisis arose when prices
            of goods fell so low that the banks could not liquidate collateral fast enough and at
            high-enough prices to provide sufficient funds to meet the demands made on their
            reserves. As confidence in the banking system decreased, demands rose, reserves fell,
            and the liquidation of collateral could not keep up with either. Accordingly, banks
            could not fulfil their obligations and had to close their doors, go bankrupt, or call
            upon governments for help. The net result was the end of financial capitalism.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This shift from financial capitalism to monopoly capitalism was made
            possible by the
            very means that bankers developed for their control of business firms. As we have seen,
            business firms came to bankers to obtain capital and were bound to remain under banking
            influence as long as their need for outside capital continued. To ensure continued
            banking control of these firms, bankers used such mechanisms as interlocking
            directorships, holding companies, consolidations, and controlled banking services. But
            these methods of banking control, by reducing competition between firms, made it
            possible to seek profits by raising prices rather than by decreasing costs and thus made
            it possible for such firms to become self-financing of their own capital needs and,
            accordingly, to be freed from banking control. In the earlier period a firm could not
            seek profits by raising prices because both competition with other firms and the limited
            supply of money anchored to the limited supply of gold made it difficult to raise prices
            of any individual product. Accordingly, profits (which are the margin between prices and
            cost) had to be sought by reducing costs. This need, incidentally, placed the interest
            of labor in opposition to management, since wages formed the chief item in costs.
            Management thus, in the periods of industrial capitalism and in the following period of
            financial capitalism, was almost inevitably opposed to the unionization of labor. But
            once financial capitalism had brought considerable elements of monopoly into the picture
            (as J. P. Morgan did when he organized the United States Steel Corporation), decreased
            competition made it possible to increase profits by raising prices faster than costs.
            This made it possible for firms to become self-financing out of their own profits, to
            dispense with bankers\' flotations and biased advice, and to reduce management\'s
            opposition to unionization of labor. As industry became more heavily capitalized, wages
            became a decreasing portion of costs, and the value of uninterrupted use of the
            expensive capital plant made it advisable to avoid labor disputes and labor stoppages by
            allowing unionization of labor and higher wages, recovering the increased costs of
            higher wages by raising the increasingly non-competitive prices of the products. Thus
            highly capitalized monopolistic industry became an exploitation of the absent consumer
            by management and labor jointly. At approximately the same time, the end of the
            international gold standard freed the supply of money from its dependence on the limited
            supply of gold (and from the maldistribution of gold arising from the bankers\'
            mismanagement of the gold standard) and thus made it possible for prices to be raised,
            perhaps indefinitely by joint labor-management actions. And finally, in the same context
            of events, the pressure to raise wages was increased by the desire to provide increased
            purchasing power to buy the growing flood of goods being produced.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The shift from financial capitalism to monopoly capitalism made
            possible a new period
            of expansion in Western civilization, but before that new mechanism could be used for
            expansive purposes the institutionalization of the previous organization of financial
            capitalism had thrown the whole society into an Age of Conflict. It is not yet clear if
            the society will be destroyed as a consequence of this or if it will be able to
            straighten itself on a new course of expansion. The structure of the new system is
            entirely different from that which existed in the period of financial capitalism before
            1929.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In that earlier period the two chief differences were (1) that the
            whole economic
            system was dominated by bankers and financiers, especially by investment bankers, and
            (2) that, as a result, the system had a financial mechanism that was basically
            deflationary because the volume of money was determined, in the final analysis, by the
            limited supply of gold. As a consequence of the first of these characteristics, the
            lines of prestige and influence in the system passed from financiers to heavy industry
            and then to light industry and commerce, after which they were diffused among petty
            bourgeois clerks, farmers, laborers, bureaucrats, and service workers. As a consequence
            of the world depression, finance was reduced to a subordinate role and a struggle arose
            about the arrangement of the other groups. In fascist states, industry, commerce, and
            petty bourgeois, by abolishing any forms of political democracy, sought to establish
            authoritarian regimes in which industry with its allies could exploit farmers, laborers,
            and consumers in general in order to favor producers in general. In \"New Deal\" and
            democratic states this did not occur, but instead labor, farmers, commercial groups, and
            to some extent consumers in general were strengthened and all groups (including reduced
            finance) became satellites around the governmental system. The control of money supply,
            which had been one of the chief attributes of the banking group before 1929, became an
            attribute of the government after 1945, and the government exercised its control under
            pressure from the shifting alliances and alignments of the great economic power blocs
            that surrounded it. These blocs came to include: (1) finance, (2) heavy industry, (3)
            light industry, (4) commercial and service groups (such as real estate), (5) civil
            servants, (6) the armed services, (7) labor, (8) farmers, (9) transportation, and
            others. If any one or several of these blocs become too obviously exploitative of the
            others, the others form an alignment to pressurize the government in another direction.
            The chief consequence of such alignments and pressures has been to increase government
            spending and thus to increase inflation. In general all these pressures have sought to
            achieve some redistribution of economic resources among the three chief claimants to
            these resources; these three are consumption, capital accumulation, and government
            services (including defense). In the financial capitalist system before 1929, the great
            danger had been the great diversion of resources toward capital accumulation to the
            jeopardy of the two others. In the new pluralistic system that has arisen, the great
            danger in many countries has been toward increasing consumption to the jeopardy of
            capital accumulation and public service. This danger has frequently appeared as a
            tendency toward inflation that would destroy capital accumulation by destroying savings.

            at least six chief points readily emerge.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the first place, I have sought to emphasize the difference between
            knowledge and
            understanding in the field of history. To know is not too demanding: it merely requires
            memory and time. But to understand is quite a different matter: it requires intellectual
            ability and training, a self-conscious awareness of what one is doing, experience in
            techniques of analysis and synthesis, and above all, perspective. Moreover, perspective
            requires a familiarity with the units of social aggregations and a recognition that
            understanding can be achieved only if we tackle societies and that it cannot be reached
            if we try to deal with social groups determined by geographic areas, political units,
            religion, nations (linguistic or \"cultural\"), or by intellectual categories such as
            veterans or middle class. To obtain knowledge we must use such groups, but to obtain
            understanding we must use the only group that is comprehensible: the society.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There is nothing very original in this first point, since it is, among
            others,
            advocated by Toynbee in the first volume of his A Study of History, but it has not been
            accepted by historians, who, in practice, continue to deal with noncomprehensible units
            such as states or nations. Moreover, Toynbee never defined his terms, and constantly
            violated his own precepts in his own practice.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The second major point is the recognition that civilizations pass
            through a process of
            rise and fall. This is, of course, one of the oldest clichés in any \"philosophy of
            history,\" and no claims to originality on that score could be made for this present
            book. But I have sought to go beyond the mere recognition of \"rise and fall\" to seek
            to
            find the mechanism of the process. Here I do not feel entitled to make any claim to
            startling originality because the process I describe—the institutionalization of social
            instruments—is clearly what was at the back of the minds of a number of earlier writers
            on the philosophy of history. I have sought to make the process explicit, so that it can
            be recognized and analyzed more readily and so that turning points in the process can be
            established with greater confidence. At the same time I have given, I hope, sufficient
            warning that this process is neither rigid nor single in any society, but rather that
            each civilization is a confused congeries of such processes in all types of human
            activities and that the explicit recognition or description of one such organization as
            the independent factor in a medley of mutually dependent factors is not a description of
            the reality (which is far too complex for any historian to describe it adequately), but
            is a technique for dealing with an irrational process similar to that used by a
            mathematician who deals with the irrationality of change by the use of a calculus based
            on untrue assumptions involving finite increments or on an assumed distinction between
            an independent variable and dependent variables. For the historian, as for the
            mathematician, I should advise that the chief task must not be a vain search for the
            factor that is independent but an explicit recognition that we are assuming the
            independence of one variable.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A third conclusion, derived from the second, is concerned with
            periodization in
            history. It has been clear for a long time that the periodizations now used are
            unsatisfactory. The division of ancient history into a Greek period, a Hellenistic
            period, and a Roman period makes no sense at all, can be maintained only by making the
            second period (connecting two linguistic divisions) vague and undefined, and clearly
            requires numerous violations of chronological order. Attempts have been made to get
            around these weaknesses in the customary division by efforts, such as Sanford\'s (in a
            textbook) to divide the Classical world into several geographic areas that advance
            chronologically side by side; these have been far from successful. In European history
            the same problem of periodization has been causing even greater dissatisfaction. The
            existing division into medieval, Renaissance, modern, and contemporary history has
            pleased no one (and has been most displeasing to the specialists on the Renaissance),
            but no substitute for these long-established divisions has been found. The greatest
            problem has arisen in the Renaissance period because of its wholly ambiguous
            relationship to the medieval period, a relationship that remains ambiguous because of
            the mistaken effort to treat the Middle Ages as a single period. As a consequence we
            find medieval history, to nonmedievalists, represented by a welter of contradictions
            called \"renaissance of the twelfth century,\" \"Age of Authority\" (or Faith), \"Dark
            Ages,\"
            and other totally misleading verbal tags. My division of the millennium 400-1400 into
            the four stages of Mixture, Gestation, Expansion, and Conflict solves many of these
            difficulties, provides tools with which to analyze aberrations like the Carolingian
            revival, and, above all, provides a vocabulary for dealing with the problem.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;On the whole, the division into seven stages is largely my own except
            that I have used
            Toynbee\'s ideas, if not his nomenclature, with reference to the last four or five
            stages. The great advantage that my seven stages provide over Toynbee\'s recognition of
            the last five of them rests in my insistence that any division into stages must be based
            on analysis of the process of \"rise and fall\" that is being discussed. It is not
            sufficient merely to describe and to devise name tags for stages based on such
            description. This is what Toynbee has done, and this is why Toynbee is so notably
            unsatisfactory in dealing with the earlier stages of any civilization\'s evolution.
            Toynbee\'s process of \"Challenge and Response\" explains nothing, is based on a
            mistaken
            Darwinian biological analogy, and provides no technique for analyzing a society or for
            communication with others about it. It is true that societies are challenged and either
            do or do not respond to these challenges. This is so true as to be quite unhelpful. The
            important point is why a society responds or fails to respond, how we can judge the
            likelihood of either beforehand, and what is the consequence of either alternative.
            Moreover, Toynbee\'s failure, already sufficiently emphasized, to correlate his process
            with his division into stages is a major weakness.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Toynbee\'s failure to provide a satisfactory analysis of process
            explains his failure
            to understand, or to provide stages for, the first part of a civilization\'s existence.
            The whole process of mixture, gestation, and incipient expansion is of vital concern to
            us today when the buffer fringe between the Western and the Soviet blocs, from Morocco
            to Indonesia, offers a real challenge in this very regard. Here Toynbee has almost
            nothing to offer, either to the peoples of those areas who are struggling to establish
            viable societies or to us who are trying to understand what is happening there.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A fifth contribution I have tried to make is concerned with
            vocabulary. This
            contribution has two parts. On the one hand, I have tried to provide a vocabulary
            sufficiently well-defined to allow communication between students of these problems, yet
            sufficiently realistic to assist explanations of what is happening or did happen in any
            society. On the other hand (and this is a major point), I have tried to establish some
            degree of sophistication in the use of historical vocabulary so that awareness of the
            subjective nature of most intellectual categories dealing with historical facts will be
            maintained. I am sure that my vocabulary is far from perfect; this is inevitable. The
            real point is that my vocabulary is fruitful: fruitful in research projects, in arousing
            original questions and interpretations, and in making communication between historians
            more helpful. No vocabulary is perfect; like everything else it is an instrument that
            becomes an institution, serving eventually to hamper thought and communication about
            these important matters. When that occurs, the old vocabulary of clichés must be
            circumvented or reformed. As it is now, the vocabulary of periodization and the
            vocabulary of analysis (by aspects or \"levels\") hamper historical understanding,
            particularly by encouraging specialization, either by period or by subject, in areas
            that are unreal, defunct, and much too narrow. The best histories of the future will
            emerge from work that straddles the older, obsolete, and unrealistic boundary lines. In
            fact, it is possible today to attract favorable attention simply by pointing out the
            artificial nature of these older boundary lines.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;All this leads to the sixth contribution offered by this book. It
            tries to provide
            techniques for dealing with history or with social problems in general. For years I have
            told my students that I have been trying to train executives rather than clerks. The
            distinction between the two is parallel to the distinction previously made between
            understanding and knowledge. It is a mighty low executive who cannot hire several people
            with command of more knowledge than he has himself. And he can always buy reference
            works or electronic devices with better memories for facts than any subordinate. The
            chief quality of an executive is that he has understanding. He should be able to make
            decisions that make it possible to utilize the knowledge of other persons. Such
            executive capacity can be taught, but it cannot be taught by any educational program
            that emphasizes knowledge and only knowledge. Knowledge must be assumed as given, and if
            it is not sufficient the candidate must be eliminated. But the vital thing is
            understanding. This requires possession of techniques that, fortunately, can be taught.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The historian who is on an executive level rather than on a clerical
            level because he
            can make decisions and understands the materials with which he deals must have
            techniques of analysis, of morphological understanding, of developmental processes, and
            of evolutionary changes. I have tried to suggest, in an introductory fashion, the kind
            of techniques that might be used. Tensions and social conflicts can be analyzed in terms
            of the struggle between instruments and institutions, or of the morphological
            relationships between levels, or of the relationship, which I hardly mentioned, between
            fact and law. Clashes between areas and between groups must be analyzed in similar
            terms. Failure to use such techniques leads to childish judgments on historical events
            just as, among practicing politicians, it leads to childish decisions in world problems.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;An example of how such techniques may be used in history might be
            helpful. For years I
            have been teaching students that historians come up against four kinds of problems.
            These are: (1) informational problems; (2) logical problems; (3) analytical problems;
            and (4) chronological problems. Techniques, capable of being taught, can be devised for
            dealing with each of these. The use of such techniques not only provides a method of
            attack on such problems; even more valuable is the fact that it makes us aware of the
            distinction between the problem and our approach to it; it becomes possible to judge the
            degree of inadequacy in our own performance or the degree to which our method of attack
            determines the kind of answer we get. Probably the achievement of such sophisticated
            self-awareness is the chief value to be derived from awareness of one\'s techniques,
            their adequacy, and their character.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The techniques I have discussed as instruments for dealing with the
            past have value
            outside the study of history, for they are equally useful in dealing with the present or
            the future. I sometimes demonstrate this to my students by imagining that one of them is
            called upon to lead a United States government commission of inquiry to Brazil, a
            country of which he knows little. I show how the techniques of analysis applied by me to
            past history can be used to approach this task by helping the leader to decide which
            experts he should take with him, how their assignments should be set on their arrival in
            Brazil, and how their results, at the end, should be coordinated to provide an adequate
            picture of a functioning Brazil beset by actual problems.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The value of these techniques, since they seek understanding rather
            than knowledge, is
            constantly high and has, if anything, increased in recent years. These years have seen,
            since Sputnik, a dramatic increase in the prestige of science and in the use of
            scientists in dealing with world problems. I should be the last person to regret this
            development, but, as a scientist, in the social sciences, I know that the problems of
            the world are not solved by the use of the natural sciences alone. Indeed, the direction
            and the coordination of scientific activities with respect to world problems require
            guidance and supervision by persons with a wider perspective than that provided by
            specialization in the natural sciences. Such perspective can best be found in the study
            of the past. With such perspective the techniques I have described in this volume as
            instruments for the study of the past can be used to guide natural scientists and other
            workers in dealing with the problems of the present and the future.
