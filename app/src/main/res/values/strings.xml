        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Evolution of Civilizations expresses two dimensions of its author,
            Carroll
            Quigley, that most extraordinary historian, philosopher, and teacher. In the first
            place, its scope is wide-ranging, covering the whole of man\'s activities throughout
            time. Second, it is analytic, not merely descriptive. It attempts a categorization of
            man\'s activities in sequential fashion so as to provide a causal explanation of the
            stages of civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley coupled enormous capacity for work with a peculiarly
            \"scientific\" approach. He
            believed that it should be possible to examine the data and draw conclusions. As a boy
            at the Boston Latin School, his academic interests were mathematics, physics, and
            chemistry. Yet during his senior year he was also associate editor of the Register, the
            oldest high school paper in the country. His articles were singled out for national
            awards by a national committee headed by George Gallup.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At Harvard, biochemistry was to be his major. But Harvard, expressing
            then
            a belief
            regarding a well-rounded education to which it has now returned, required a core
            curriculum including a course in the humanities. Quigley chose a history course,
            \"Europe Since the Fall of Rome.\" Always a contrary man, he was graded at the top of
            his class in
            physics and calculus and drew a C in the history course. But the development of ideas
            began to assert its fascination for him, so he elected to major in history. He graduated
            magna cum laude as the top history student in his class.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley was always impatient. He stood for his doctorate oral
            examination
            at the end
            of his second year of graduate studies. Charles Howard McIlwain, chairman of the
            examining board, was very impressed by Quigley\'s answer to his opening question; the
            answer included a long quotation in Latin from Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln in
            the thirteenth century. Professor Mcllwain sent Quigley to Princeton University as a
            graduate student instructor.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the spring of 1937 I was a student in my senior year at Princeton.
            Quigley was my
            preceptor in medieval history. He was Boston Irish; I was New York Irish. Both of us,
            Catholics adventuring in a strangely Protestant establishment world, were fascinated by
            the Western intellectual tradition anchored in Augustine, Abelard, and Aquinas that
            seemed to have so much more richness and depth than contemporary liberalism. We became
            very close in a treasured friendship that was terminated only by his death.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the course of rereading The Evolution of Civilizations I was
            reminded
            of the
            intensity of our dialogue. In Quigley\'s view, which I shared, our age was one of
            irrationality. That spring we talked about what career decisions I should make. At his
            urging I applied to and was admitted by the Harvard Graduate School in History. But I
            had reservations about an academic career in the study of the history that I loved, on
            the ground that on Quigley\'s own analysis the social decisions of importance in our
            lifetime would be made in ad hoc irrational fashion in the street. On that reasoning,
            finally I transferred to law school.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Princeton, Carroll Quigley met and married Lillian Fox. They spent
            their honeymoon
            in Paris and Italy on a fellowship to write his doctoral dissertation, a study of the
            public administration of the Kingdom of Italy, 1805-14. The development of the state in
            western Europe over the last thousand years always fascinated Quigley. He regarded the
            development of public administration in the Napoleonic states as a major step in the
            evolution of the modern state. It always frustrated him that each nation, including our
            own, regards its own history as unique and the history of other nations as irrelevant to
            it.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In 1938-41, Quigley served a stint at Harvard, tutoring graduate
            students
            in ancient
            and medieval history. It offered little opportunity for the development of cosmic views
            and he was less than completely content there. It was, however, a happy experience for
            me. I had entered Harvard Law School. We began the practice of having breakfast together
            at Carroll and Lillian\'s apartment.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In 1941 Quigley accepted a teaching appointment at Georgetown\'s
            School of
            Foreign
            Service. It was to engage his primary energies throughout the rest of his busy life.
            There he became an almost legendary teacher. He chose to teach a course, \"The
            Development of Civilization,\" required of the incoming class, and that course
            ultimately
            provided the structure and substance for The Evolution of Civilizations. As a course in
            his hands, it was a vital intellectual experience for young students, a mind-opening
            adventure. Foreign Service School graduates, meeting years later in careers around the
            world, would establish rapport with each other by describing their experience in his
            class. It was an intellectual initiation with remembered impact that could be shared by
            people who had graduated years apart.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The fortunes of life brought us together again. During World War II I
            served as a very
            junior officer on Admiral King\'s staff in Washington. Carroll and I saw each other
            frequently. Twenty years later, after practicing law in Oregon, I came into the
            government with President Kennedy. Our eldest daughter became a student under Carroll at
            Georgetown University. We bought a house close by Carroll and Lillian. I had Sunday
            breakfast with them for years and renewed our discussions of the affairs of a
            disintegrating world.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Superb teacher Quigley was, and could justify a lifetime of prodigious
            work on that
            success alone. But ultimately he was more. To me he was a figure—he would scoff at this—
            like Augustine, Abelard, and Aquinas, searching for the truth through examination of
            ultimate reality as it was revealed in history. Long ago, he left the church in the
            formal sense. Spiritually and intellectually he never left it. He never swerved from his
            search for the meaning of life. He never placed any goal in higher priority. If the God
            of the Western civilization that Quigley spent so many years studying does exist in the
            terms that he saw ascribed to him by our civilization, that God will now have welcomed
            Quigley as one who has pleased him.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In an age characterized by violence, extraordinary personal
            alienation,
            and the
            disintegration of family, church, and community, Quigley chose a life dedicated to
            rationality. He addressed the problem of explaining change in the world around us, first
            examined by Heraclitus in ancient Greece. Beneath that constant change, so apparent and
            itself so real, what is permanent and unchanging?
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley wanted an explanation that in its very categorization would
            give
            meaning to a
            history which was a record of constant change. Therefore the analysis had to include but
            not be limited to categories of subject areas of human activity—military, political,
            economic, social, religious, intellectual. It had to describe change in categories
            expressed sequentially in time—mixture, gestation, expansion, conflict, universal
            empire, decay, invasion. It was a most ambitious effort to make history rationally
            understandable. F. E. Manuel, in his review of this book for the American Historical
            Review, following its first publication in 1961, described it as on \"sounder ground\"
            than the work of Toynbee.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley found the explanation of disintegration in the gradual
            transformation of
            social \"instruments\" into \"institutions,\" that is, the transformation of social
            arrangements functioning to meet real social needs into social institutions serving
            their own purposes regardless of real social needs. In an ideologically Platonistic
            society, social arrangements are molded to express a rigidly idealized version of
            reality. Such institutionalization would not have the flexibility to accommodate to the
            pressures of changing reality for which the ideology has no categories of thought that
            will allow perception, analysis, and handling. But the extraordinary distinction of
            Western civilization is that its ontology allows an open-ended epistemology. It is
            engaged in a constant effort to understand reality which is perceived as in constant
            change. Therefore, our categories of knowledge are themselves always subject to change.
            As a consequence reform is always possible.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The question today is whether we have lost that Western view of
            reality
            which has
            given our 2,000 years of history its unique vitality, constantly pregnant with new
            versions of social structure. In Evolution, Quigley describes the basic ideology of
            Western civilization as expressed in the statement, \"The truth unfolds in time through
            a
            communal process.\" Therefore, Quigley saw the triumph in the thirteenth century of the
            moderate realism of Aquinas over dualistic exaggerated realism derived from Platonism as
            the major epistemologic triumph that opened up Western civilization. People must
            constantly search for the \"truth\" by building upon what others have learned. But no
            knowledge can be assumed to be complete and final. It could be contradicted by new
            information received tomorrow. In epistemology, Quigley always retained his belief in
            the scientific method. Therefore, he saw Hegel and Marx as presumptuous, in error, and
            outside the Western tradition in their analysis of history as an ideologic dialectic
            culminating in the present or immediate future in a homeostatic condition.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Quigley comments upon the constant repetition of conflict and
            expansion
            stages in
            Western history. That reform process owes its possibility to the uniquely Western belief
            that truth is continually unfolding. Therefore Western civilization is capable of
            re-examining its direction and its institutions, and changing both as appears necessary.
            So in Western history, there was a succession of technological breakthroughs in
            agricultural practice and in commerce. Outmoded institutions like feudalism and—in the
            commercial area—municipal mercantilism in the period 1270- 1440, and state mercantilism
            in the period 1690-1810 were discarded. Similarly, we may also survive the economic
            crisis described by Quigley as monopoly capitalism in the present post-1900 period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Yet Quigley perceives—correctly in my view—the possible termination of
            open-ended
            Western civilization. With access to an explosive technology that can tear the planet
            apart, coupled with the failure of Western civilization to establish any viable system
            of world government, local political authority will tend to become violent and
            absolutist. As we move into irrational activism, states will seize upon ideologies that
            justify absolutism. The 2,000-year separation in Western history of state and society
            would then end. Western people would rejoin those of the rest of the world in merging
            the two into a single entity, authoritarian and static. The age that we are about to
            enter would be an ideologic one consistent with the views of Hegel and Marx—a
            homeostatic condition. That triumph would end the Western experiment and return us to
            the experience of the rest of the world—namely, that history is a sequence of stages in
            the rise and fall of absolutist ideologies.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;America is now in a crisis-disintegrating stage. In such a condition,
            absent a
            philosophy, people turn readily to charismatic personalities. So at the beginning of our
            time of troubles, in the depression of the 1930s, we turned to Franklin D. Roosevelt. He
            took us through the depression and World War II. We were buoyed by his optimism and
            reassured by the strength and confidence of his personality. Within the Western
            tradition he provided us with no solutions; he simply preserved options. When he died,
            all America was in shock. We had lost our shield. Carroll came over to my place that
            night. We talked in the subdued fashion of a generation that had lost its guardian and
            would now have to face a hostile world on its own.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since then we in America have been denied the easy-out of charismatic
            leadership. It
            may just be that we shall have to follow the route that Quigley has marked out for us in
            this book. We may have to look at our history, analyze it, establish an identity in that
            analysis, and make another try at understanding reality in a fashion consistent with
            that open-ended tradition.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If so, America, acting for Western civilization, must find within the
            history of that
            civilization the intellectual and spiritual reserves to renew itself within the
            tradition. Striking as was the impact of this book at the time of its first publication,
            in 1961, its major impact will be in support of that effort in the future. There is hope
            that in Western civilization the future ideology will be rational. If so, it would be
            consistent with an epistemology that accepts the general validity of sensory experience
            and the possibility of making generalizations from that experience, subject to
            modification as additional facts are perceived. It is that epistemology which was termed
            moderate realism in the thirteenth century and, in its epistemologic aspects, is now
            known as the scientific method. Such a rational ideology is probable only if it is
            developed out of the special history of the West. As appreciation of that spreads, the
            kind of analysis that Carroll Quigley develops in this book is the analysis that the
            West must use.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Such an effort would be consistent in social terms with Quigley\'s
            view of
            his own
            life. He greatly admired his mother, a housewife, and his father, a Boston firechief,
            and described them as teaching him to do his best at whatever he chose to put his
            energies. That was their way of saying what Carroll would have described as man\'s
            responsibility to understand and relate actively to a continually unfolding reality. He
            dedicated his life to that purpose.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This book is not a history. Rather it is an attempt to establish
            analytical tools that
            will assist the understanding of history. Most historians will regard such an effort as
            unnecessary or even impossible. Some answer must be made to these two objections.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Those who claim that no analytical tools are needed in order to write
            history are
            naive. To them the facts of history are relatively few and are simply arranged. The
            historian\'s task is merely to find these facts; their arrangement will be obvious. But
            it should require only a moment\'s thought to recognize that the facts of the past are
            infinite, and the possible arrangements of any selection from these facts are equally
            numerous. Since all the facts cannot be mobilized in any written history because of
            their great number, there must be some principle on which selection from these facts is
            based. Such a principle is a tool of historical analysis. Any sophisticated historian
            should be aware of the principles he uses and should be explicit to his readers about
            these. After all, any past event, even the writing of this book, is a fact of history,
            but most such facts, including this book, do not deserve to be mentioned in the
            narration of history.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If historians are not explicit, at least to themselves, about their
            principles of
            selection among the facts of the past and among the many possible arrangements of these
            facts, all histories will be simply accidental compilations that cannot be justified in
            any rational way. Historians will continue to write about some of the events of history
            while neglecting others equally significant or even more significant, and they will form
            patterns for these facts along lines determined by traditional (and basically
            accidental) lines or in reflection of old controversies about the patterns of these
            facts.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This, indeed, is pretty much what we have in history today. In
            American
            history, for
            example, dozens of books examine and re-examine the same old issues without, in most
            cases, contributing much that is new or different. The central fact of American history
            is the process by which a society with European cultural patterns was modified by the
            selective process of emigration from Europe and the opportunity to exploit the enormous,
            largely virgin, resources of the New World. Yet in most histories of the United States,
            this subject is hardly mentioned. Instead we have volume after volume of discussion on
            the rivalry of Jeffersonians and Hamiltonians or on the unrealistic problem whether the
            American Civil War was a repressible or an irrepressible conflict or on whether the
            American lapse into isolationism after World War I was caused more by the vindictiveness
            of Lodge or the inflexibility of Wilson.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;To the non-American world the central fact of American history is
            American
            technology—what they used to call \"Fordism,\" meaning mass production. Until very
            recently there was no history of American technology in existence, and even today this
            vital subject obtains only incidental mention, with an almost total lack of real
            understanding, in most histories of the United States.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As we have said, the content of most books depends upon accidental
            factors
            or, at
            most, on the rehash of ancient controversies. The Civil War has commanded major
            attention, but there is little recognition of the real significance of this war; namely,
            that after giving an impetus to industrialization, it left a residue of emotional
            patterns that alienated the farmers of the South and the farmers of the West so that the
            country could be dominated politically by the high finance and heavy industry of the
            East. This situation, which forms the essential background for such familiar phenomena
            as the agrarian discontent and third-party movements of the period 1873-1933, as well as
            the attacks on political machines and the rise of civil service, or the growth of
            muckraking or progressivism, and of government regulation of business, is rarely
            presented in adequate fashion as the background that it is. Instead these events are
            mentioned as if they were merely accidental occurrences related in some obscure fashion
            to the idiosyncrasies of Americans. And the average college student of American history
            finishes his study without any idea why the Republican party became the party of big
            business in 1892-1932, what the Whitneys contributed to American life, or the
            significant contributions of Joseph Henry or Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839-1903) to the
            world today.

            been fought and refought (with four major books in the last six months), just as if the

            the Battle of Petersburg, which is of far greater tactical significance (since it was a

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Matters are no better in European history. To mention only one point,
            in
            which I am
            personally very interested, the one dominant central fact of European history over the
            last thousand years has been the almost steady growth of public authority and the public
            services. We could never guess this from the history books. Or again, reams have been
            written on the French Revolution and its origins, yet some of the most vital points are
            hardly mentioned. We have been told repeatedly that the government of the Old Regime was
            \"absolute\" and that the Revolution began because this regime was financially
            \"bankrupt.\"
            Few have seen the paradox lying in a situation where an \"absolute state\" could not tax
            its subjects. A colleague on the faculty at Princeton once stated in conversation as a
            fact that the Revolution occurred in France because that country was the most advanced
            in Europe. When I replied that, in my opinion, the Revolution came in France because the
            French government was one of the most backward in Europe, he was astonished. I am not
            trying here to consider this problem; I am simply trying to point out that this is a
            problem that certainly should have been examined in connection with the study of the
            French Revolution and that just as surely would have been discussed in any historical
            work based on rational tools of historical analysis. Because such tools have not been
            used, study of the French Revolution, like the study of other matters, has concentrated
            its attention on those aspects of the problem that came to be discussed largely for
            traditional and accidental reasons. In fact, the chief force directing the
            historiography of the French Revolution has not been a determined effort to find what
            happened but rather has been the party conflicts of the Third French Republic. Once
            these partisan motivations are rejected, a history of the French Revolution could be
            written that, with equal justification, would have discussed quite different aspects of
            the subject. Without principles of selection among the facts and theories, one selection
            is as well justified as another on any grounds outside tradition.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;So much for the historians who say that tools of historical analysis
            are
            unnecessary.
            To the much smaller group of historians who say that such tools are impossible to
            obtain, I can only offer this book as an attempt. This group of critics is much more
            difficult to deal with. They are skeptics sophisticated enough to recognize that there
            is a problem, but not consistent enough to cease being historians when they insist that
            there is no solution. The only justification they can offer is to fall back on tradition
            once again. These skeptics recognize the infinity of past facts and the subjectivity of
            the criteria usually used in making a selection from these facts, but they are content
            to continue to work with the traditionally acceptable selections from both. I offer them
            here principles of selection based on the methods used in science, but I recognize the
            difficulty of the problem of persuading them that I have anything helpful. As skeptics
            these people are almost impervious to persuasion.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;During the summer that I was twelve years old, I walked four or five
            times
            a week to
            fish from Hingham Bridge. The distance was about five miles, part of it along a high
            railroad embankment that had been ballasted with crushed quartz. In this ballast were
            hundreds of quartz crystals. Each day I stopped awhile to look for a perfect crystal. I
            found some excellent ones, but never one that could be called perfect. The books I
            consulted told me that a quartz crystal should be a hexagonal prism with a regular
            hexagonal pyramid at the end. The ones I found were invariably irregular in some way,
            with sides of varying sizes, frequently with several crystals jammed together so that,
            in seeking to share the same material, they mutually distorted each other\'s hexagonal
            regularity.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;After several weeks of casual searching, I found three or four
            crystals
            that were
            almost perfect, at least at the pyramidal end. But to find these, I had examined and
            discarded hundreds of distorted crystals. By what right, I asked, did the books say that
            quartz crystals occurred in regular pyramidal hexagonal prisms when only a small
            percentage of those found had such a shape? Obviously, the books meant that crystallized
            quartz has a tendency to take hexagonal form and will do so unless distorted by outside
            forces. The fact that ninety-nine percent are distorted does not deter the scientist
            from forming in his mind an idealized picture of an undistorted crystal, or from
            stating, in books, that quartz crystals occur in that idealized form.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Later, when I studied science in school and college, I found that most
            scientific
            \"laws\" were of this idealized character. They were not statements of what actually
            happens in the world or of what we observe through our senses, but rather were highly
            idealized and much oversimplified relationships that might occur if a great many other
            influences, which were always present, were neglected. I found that the most highly
            praised \"scientific laws\" attributed to great men like Galileo or Newton were of this
            character. It was a blow to discover that Newton\'s laws of planetary motion did not, in
            fact, describe the movements of the sun\'s satellites as we observe them, except in a
            very approximate way. In some cases, notably that of the planet Mercury, the
            approximation was by no means close.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Still later, when my interests shifted from the physical sciences to
            the
            social
            sciences, and I worked with students of human society who were generally lacking in any
            close familiarity with the natural sciences, I found a curious situation. The social
            scientists usually had erroneous ideas about the methods and theories of natural
            science, believing them to be rigid, exact, and invariable. Accordingly, they felt that
            these methods were not applicable to the social sciences. Thus I found that natural
            scientists were quite prepared to accept as a \"law\" a rule that was only approximately
            true or was true in only one case in a hundred, while the social scientists were
            reluctant to accept any rule that was only approximate or even one that had no more than
            one exception in a hundred cases.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;After years of work in both areas of study, I concluded that the
            social
            sciences were
            different, in many important ways, from the natural sciences, but that the same
            scientific methods were applicable in both areas, and, indeed, that no very useful work
            could be done in either area except by scientific methods. In both areas the laws
            arising from the use of scientific methods will be idealized theories reflecting
            observed phenomena only approximately, but these theories must be based on our
            observations; and any wide failure of approximation or any totally inapplicable cases
            must either be explained in terms of unconsidered outside factors, or the theories
            themselves must be changed to cover such variant observations. The \"laws\" of
            historical
            change described in this book seem to me to fit the observed cases at least as closely
            as most of the theories of natural science. Most of the laws I shall mention apply,
            without exception, or with only slight, explicable divergencies, to all the cases I
            know. They are then, it would seem to me, as worthy of consideration as the scientific
            laws on the formation of crystals.

    <array name="content_1_2_1">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Before proceeding to examine any theories of historical change, we
            should
            review what
            we understand by the term \"scientific method.\" In general, this method has three parts
            which we might call (1) gathering evidence, (2) making a hypothesis, and (3) testing the
            hypothesis. The first of these, \"gathering evidence,\" refers to collecting all the
            observations relevant to the topic being studied. The important point here is that we
            must have all the evidence, for, obviously, omission of a few observations, or even one
            vital case, might make a considerable change in our final conclusions. It is equally
            obvious, I hope, that we cannot judge that we have all the evidence or cannot know what
            observations are relevant to our subject unless we already have some kind of tentative
            hypothesis or theory about the nature of that subject. In most cases a worker does have
            some such preliminary theory. This leads to two warnings. In the first place, the three
            parts of scientific methodology listed above were listed in order, not because a
            scientist performs them separately in sequence, but simply because we must discuss them
            in an orderly fashion. And, in the second place, any theories, even those regarded as
            final conclusions at the end of all three parts of scientific method, remain tentative.
            As scientific methodology is practiced, all three parts are used together at all stages,
            and therefore no theory, however rigorously tested, is ever final, but remains at all
            times tentative, subject to new observation and continued testing by such observation.
            No scientist ever believes that he has the final answer or the ultimate truth on
            anything. Rather he feels that science advances by a series of successive (and, he
            hopes, closer) approximations to the truth; and, since the truth is never finally
            reached, the work of scientists must indefinitely continue. Science, as one writer put
            it, is like a single light in darkness; as it grows brighter its shows more clearly the
            area of illumination and, simultaneously, lengthens the circle of surrounding darkness.

    <array name="content_1_2_2">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Having gathered all the \"relevant\" evidence, the scientist may
            proceed
            to
            the second
            part of scientific methodology, making a hypothesis. In doing this, two rules must be
            followed: (a) the hypothesis must explain all the observations and (b) the hypothesis
            must be the simplest one that will explain them. These two rules might be summed up in
            the statement that a scientific hypothesis must be adequate and it must be simple. Once
            again let us confess that these two rules are idealistic rather than practicable, but
            they remain, nevertheless, the goals by which a scientist guides his activities.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that a hypothesis must be adequate, and thus must include
            all
            of the
            relevant observations, we are saying something simple. But carrying out this simple
            admonition is extremely difficult. It is quite true that every scientific hypothesis
            suffers from inadequate evidence—that is, it does not include in its explanation all the
            relevant evidence, and would be different if it did so. It is not easy to tear any event
            out of the context of the universe in which it occurred without detaching it from some
            factor that has influenced it. This is difficult enough in the physical sciences. It is
            immensely more difficult in the social sciences. It is likely that in any society the
            factors influencing an event are so numerous that any effort to detach an event from its
            social context must inevitably do violence to it. The extreme specialization of most
            social studies today, concentrating attention on narrow fields and brief periods, is a
            great hindrance to our understanding of such special fields, although the fact is not so
            widely recognized as it should be, since any specialist\'s work is usually examined only
            by his fellow specialists who have the same biases and blind spots as he does himself.
            But a specialist from one area of study who examines the work being done in some other
            area cannot fail to notice how the overspecialized training of the experts in his new
            area of interest has handicapped their understanding of that area.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The second requirement of a scientific hypothesis—that it should be
            simple—is also
            more difficult to carry out in practice than it is to write down in words. Essentially,
            it means that a hypothesis should explain the existing observations by making the fewest
            assumptions and by inferring the simplest relationships. This is so vital that a
            hypothesis is scientific or fails to be scientific on this point alone. Yet in spite of
            its importance, this requirement of scientific method is frequently not recognized to be
            important by many active scientists. The requirement that a scientific hypothesis must
            be \"simple\" or, as it is sometimes expressed, \"economical\" does not arise merely
            from a
            scientist\'s desire to be simple. Nor does it arise from some esthetic urge, although
            this is not so remote from the problem as might seem at first glance. When a
            mathematician says of a mathematical demonstration that it is \"beautiful,\" he means
            exactly what the word \"beautiful\" means to the rest of us, and this same element is
            undoubtedly significant in the formulation of theory by a scientist as well.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The rule of simplicity or economy in scientific hypothesis has a
            number of
            corollaries. One of these, called \"the uniformity of nature,\" assumes that the whole
            universe is made of the same substances and obeys the same laws and, accordingly, will
            behave in the same way under the same conditions. Such an assumption does not have to be
            proved —indeed, it could not be proved. It is made for two reasons. First, because it is
            simpler to assume that things are the same than it is to assume that they are different.
            And, second, while we cannot prove this assumption to be correct even if it is correct,
            we can, if it is not correct, show this by finding a single exceptional case. We could
            demonstrate the uniformity of nature only by comparing all parts of the universe with
            all other parts, something that clearly could never be achieved. But we can assume this,
            because it is a simpler hypothesis than its contrary; and, if it is wrong, we can show
            this error by producing one case of a substance or a physical law that is different in
            one place or time from other places or times. To speak briefly, we might say that
            scientific assumptions cannot be proved but they can be refuted, and they must always be
            put in a form that will allow such refutation.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Other examples or applications of the rule of uniformity of nature
            would
            be the
            scientific assumptions that \"man is part of nature\" or that \"all men have the same
            potentialities.\" Neither of these could be proved, because this would involve the
            impossible task of comparing all men with one another (including both past and future
            men) and with nonhuman nature, but these assumptions can be made under the rule of
            simplicity of scientific hypothesis or its corollary, the rule of the uniformity of
            nature. Thus they do not require proof. But, on the other hand, if these assumptions are
            not correct, they could be disproved by one, or a few clear-cut cases of exceptions to
            the rule.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus, in the final analysis, these rules about scientific hypotheses
            are
            not derived
            from any sense of economy or of esthetics, but rather arise from the nature of
            demonstration and proof. The familiar judicial rule that a man is to be assumed innocent
            until he has been proved guilty is based on the same fundamental principles as these
            rules about scientific hypotheses, and, like these, rests ultimately on the nature of
            proof. We must assume that a man is innocent (not guilty) until we have proof of his
            guilt because it is always simpler to assume that things are not so than to assume that
            they are, and also because no man can prove the negative \"not guilty\" except by the
            impossible procedure of producing proof of innocence during every moment of his past
            life. (If he omits a moment, the charge of guilt could then be focused on the period for
            which proof of innocence is unobtainable.) But by making the general and negative
            assumption of innocence for all men, we can disprove this for any single man by the much
            easier procedure of producing evidence of guilt for a single time, place, and deed.
            Since it is true that a general negative cannot be demonstrated, we are entitled to make
            that general negative assumption under the rule of the simplicity of scientific
            hypothesis, and to demand refutation of such an assumption by specific positive proof.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A familiar example of this method could be seen in the fact that we
            cannot
            be required
            to prove that ghosts and sea serpents and clairvoyance do not exist. Scientifically we
            assume that these things do not exist, and require no evidence to justify this
            assumption, while the burden of producing proofs must fall on anyone who says that such
            things do exist.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The rule of simplicity in scientific hypotheses is by no means
            something
            new. First
            formulated in the late Middle Ages, it was known as \"Occam\'s razor\" and was applied
            chiefly to logic. Later it was applied to the natural sciences. Most persons believe
            that Galileo and his contemporaries made their great contributions to science by
            refuting Aristotle. This \"refutation of Aristotle,\" or, more correctly, \"refutation
            of
            Plato and of the Pythagorean rationalists,\" was only incidental to the much more
            significant achievement of making the commonly accepted rules about the universe more
            scientific by applying to them Occam\'s razor. This was done by assuming that the
            heavenly bodies and terrestrial objects operate under the same laws (laws that were
            later enunciated by Newton). This application of Occam\'s razor to natural phenomena was
            a major step forward in making the study of nature scientific. Application of this rule
            to the social sciences (that is, to phenomena involving subjective factors) still
            remains to be done, and would provide a similar impetus to the advance of this area of
            human thinking. It has already been done in judicial procedure (by such rules as the
            assumption of innocence and the needlessness of proving negatives), and the chief task
            in American law at the present time is to protect and, if necessary, extend the
            application of Occam\'s razor to judicial procedure. Many persons in recent years have
            felt uncomfortable over the demand that certain persons should \"prove\" that they are
            not
            \"communists,\" but few realized that the unfairness of such a demand rests on the
            nature
            of scientific assumption and the nature of proof and, above all, on the violation of
            Occam\'s razor.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These rules about the nature of scientific hypothesis are so important
            that science
            would perish if they were not observed. This has already happened in the past. During
            the period 600-400 B.C. in the Greek-speaking world, the Ionian scientists applied these
            rules about scientific hypothesis by assuming that the heavens and the earth were made
            of the same substance and obeyed the same laws and that man was part of nature. The
            enemies of science about the year 400 B.C. made assumptions quite different from those
            of the Ionians; namely, that the heavens were made of a substance different from those
            on earth and, accordingly, obeyed different laws, and, furthermore, that man was not
            part of nature (since he was a spiritual being). They accepted the older idea that the
            earth was made up of four elements (earth, water, air, fire), but assumed that the
            heavens were made of a quite different fifth element, quintessence. They admitted that
            the earth was changeable but insisted that the celestial areas were rigidly unchanging.
            They claimed that the laws of motion in the two were quite different, objects on the
            earth moving naturally in straight lines at decreasing velocity to their natural
            condition of rest, while objects in the heavens moved in perfect circles at constant
            speed as their natural condition. These nonscientific assumptions, made about 400 B.C.
            without proof and by violating the fundamental rules of scientific method, set up a
            nonscientific world view which could not be disproved. The Pythagorean rationalists were
            able to do this and to destroy science because the scientists of that day, like many
            scientists of today, had no clear idea of scientific method and were therefore in no
            position to defend it. Even today few scientists and perhaps even fewer nonscientists
            realize that science is a method and nothing else. Even in books pretending to be
            authoritative, we are told that science is a body of knowledge or that science is
            certain areas of study. It is neither of these. Science clearly could be a body of
            knowledge only if we were willing to use the name for something that is constantly
            changing. From week to week, even from day to day, the body of knowledge to which we
            attribute the name science is changing, the beliefs of one day being, sooner or later,
            abandoned for quite different beliefs.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Closely related to the erroneous idea that science is a body of
            knowledge
            is the
            equally erroneous idea that scientific theories are true. One example of this belief is
            the idea that such theories begin as hypotheses and somehow are \"proved\" and become
            \"laws.\" There is no way in which any scientific theory could be proved, and as a
            result
            such theories always remain hypotheses. The fact that such theories \"work\" and permit
            us
            to manipulate and even transform the physical world is no proof that these theories are
            true. Many theories that were clearly untrue have \"worked\" and continue to work for
            long
            periods. The belief that the world is a flat surface did not prevent men from moving
            about on its surface successfully. The acceptance of \"Aristotelian\" beliefs about
            falling bodies did not keep people from dealing with such bodies, and doing so with
            considerable success. Men could have played baseball on a flat world under Aristotle\'s
            laws and still pitched curves and hit home runs with as much skill as they do today.
            Eventually, to be sure, erroneous theories will fail to work and their falseness will be
            revealed, but it may take a very long time for this to happen, especially if men
            continue to operate in the limited areas in which the erroneous theories were
            formulated.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus scientific theories must be recognized as hypotheses and as
            subjective human
            creations no matter how long they remain unrefuted. Failure to recognize this helped to
            kill ancient science in the days of the Greeks. At that time the chief enemies of
            science were the rationalists. These men, with all the prestige of Pythagoras and Plato
            behind them, argued that the human senses are not dependable but are erroneous and
            misleading and that, accordingly, the truth must be sought without using the senses and
            observation, and by the use of reason and logic alone. The scientists of the day were
            trying to reduce the complexity of innumerable observed qualities to the simplicity of
            quantitative differences of a few fundamental elements. This is, of course, exactly what
            scientists have always done, seeking to explain the subjective complexity of qualitative
            differences, such as temperature, color, texture, and hardness, in quantitative terms.
            But in doing this they introduced a dichotomy between \"appearance\" and \"reality\"
            that
            became one of the fundamental categories of ancient intellectual controversy. All
            things, as the scientists said, may be made up of different proportions of the four
            basic elements—earth, water, air, fire—but they certainly do not appear to be. The same
            problem arises in our own day when scientists tell us that the most solid piece of rock
            or metal is very largely made up of empty space between minute electrical charges.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Pythagoreans argued that if things are really not what they seem,
            our
            senses are
            at fault because they reveal to us the appearance (which is not true) rather than the
            reality (which is true). This being so, the senses are undependable and erroneous and
            should not be used by us to determine the nature of reality; instead we should use the
            same reason and logic that showed us that reality was not like the appearance of things.
            It was this recourse to rational processes independent of observation that led the
            ancient rationalists to assume the theories violating Occam\'s razor that became
            established as \"Aristotelian\" and dominated men\'s ideas of the universe until, almost
            two thousand years later, they were refuted by Galileo and others who re-established
            observation and Occam\'s razor in scientific procedure.

            can be
            done in
            three ways: (a) by checking back, (b) by foretelling new observations, and (c) by
            experimentation with controls. Of these the first two are simple enough. We check back
            by examining all the evidence used in formulating the hypothesis to make sure that the
            hypothesis can explain each observation.

            to predict the exact time and place for a future eclipse of the sun, or if the theory
            makes it possible for us to calculate the size and position of an unknown planet that is
            subsequently found through the telescope, we may regard our hypotheses as greatly
            strengthened.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The third type of test of a hypothesis, experimentation with controls,
            is
            somewhat
            more complicated. If a man had a virus he believed to be the cause of some disease, he
            might test it by injecting some of it into the members of a group. Even if each person
            who had been injected came down with the disease, the experiment would not be a
            scientific one and would prove nothing. The persons injected could have been exposed to
            another common source of infection, and the injection might have had nothing to do with
            the disease. In order to have a scientific experiment, we must not inject every member
            of the group but only every other member, keeping the uninjected alternate members under
            identical conditions except for the fact that they have not been injected with the
            virus. The injected members we call the experimental group; the uninjected persons we
            call the control group. If all other conditions are the same for both groups, and the
            injected experimental group contract the disease while the control group do not, we have
            fairly certain evidence that the virus causes the disease. Notice that the conditions of
            the control group and the experimental group are the same except for one factor that is
            different (the injection), a fact allowing us to attribute any difference in final
            result to the one factor that is different.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The nature of experimentation with controls must be clearly
            understood,
            because it has
            frequently been distorted from ignorance or malice. A number of years ago a book called
            Science Is a Sacred Cow made a malicious attack on science. In this work the method of
            experimental science was explained somewhat like this: on Monday I drink whiskey and
            water and get drunk; on Tuesday I drink gin and water and get drunk; on Wednesday I
            drink vodka and water and get drunk; on Thursday I think about this and decide that
            water makes me drunk, since this is the only common action I did every day. This
            perversion of scientific method is the exact opposite of a scientific experiment. In
            this performance we assumed that all conditions were different except one, and
            attributed cause to the one condition that was the same. In scientific method we
            establish all conditions the same except one, and attribute causation to the one factor
            that is different. In the perversion of scientific method we made an assumption that was
            not proved and probably could not be proved—that all conditions, except drinking water,
            were different—and then we tried to attribute causation to the one common factor. But
            there never could be only one factor the same, since, as an experimental animal, I was
            breathing air each day and doing a number of other common actions, including drinking
            alcohol.

            Science Is a Sacred Cow, attracted undeserved attention and was publicized in America\'s
            most widely read picture magazine as a worthy book and a salutary effort to readjust the
            balance of America\'s idolatry of science. The magazine article in question reprinted
            extracts from the book, including the section on experimental method, and seriously
            presented to millions of readers the experimental proof that water is an intoxicant as
            an example of scientific method.

            also
            been
            questioned on the ground that theories of the social sciences are too changeable. We are
            told that every generation must rewrite the history of the past or even that every
            individual must form his own picture of history. This may be true to some extent, but it
            is almost equally true of the natural sciences. Science is a method, not a body of
            knowledge or a picture of the world. The method remains largely unchanged, except for
            refinements, generation after generation, but the body of scientific knowledge resulting
            from the use of this method or the world picture it provides is changing from month to
            month and almost from day to day. The scientific picture of the universe today is quite
            different from that of even so recent a man as Einstein, and immensely different from
            those of Pasteur and Newton. And even at a given moment the body of knowledge possessed
            by any single scientist or the world picture he has made from that knowledge is quite
            different from that possessed by other scientists. Yet such persons are all worthy to be
            called scientists if they use scientific method. The same is true in the social
            sciences.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The one major difference between the natural sciences and the social
            sciences is the
            assumption, made in the former, that human thoughts cannot influence what happens. This
            is an assumption, justified by the rule of simplicity, although few persons recognize
            that it is. There is a considerable body of evidence that human thoughts can influence
            the physical world, but this evidence, segregated into such fields as parapsychology or
            the psychic world, is not acceptable to the natural sciences. As a result, phenomena
            such as poltergeist manifestations (largely because they cannot be repeated on request)
            go unexplained and are generally ignored by the natural sciences. The latter continue to
            assume that physical processes are immune to spiritual influences.

            human thoughts
            can influence what happens; and, accordingly, the social scientist must face the more
            complicated situation created by this admission. Thus we assume that a rock, dropped
            from a high window, will fall even if everyone in the world expected it to rise or
            wanted it to rise. On the other hand, we are quite prepared to see the price of General
            Motors common stock rise if any large group of people expects it to rise. In a somewhat

            hatch in due time from the heat of the sun. Eventually the little turtles emerge from
            their shells, push up through the warm sand, and head for the sea. There, guided by a
            sure instinct and without any need for instruction or learning, they take care of

            unfamiliar. Insects do so and so too do such animals as chicks and ducklings. But man is
            constructed on an entirely different plan. When a baby is born, it is quite incapable of
            taking care of itself, and remains relatively helpless for years. Indeed, it would seem
            that twenty or more years are necessary before a human being reaches maturity.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The helpless condition of the new-born human arises from the fact that
            his
            neurological and muscular systems are largely undeveloped and uncoordinated. His nervous
            system in particular is like the telephone system of a great city in which almost none
            of the connections from phone to phone or from phone to switchboard are closed. Of
            course, this comparison is by no means perfect, for the human nervous system is much
            more complicated, much more adaptable, and much faster than any telephone system. The
            human brain alone, as a kind of central switchboard, has millions of neural connections.
            Other millions are distributed throughout the body. The way in which these are connected
            up, or even the fact that they come to be connected up at all, depends on what happens
            to the child, how he is trained, and how he grows. The things he is capable of becoming
            originally we can speak of as his potentialities; the things he does become, as the
            result of experience and training, we can speak of as actualities. The sum of his
            potentialities we call human nature, while the sum total of his actualities we call
            human personality. It is quite clear that human nature (potential qualities) is very
            much wider than human personality (actually developed qualities). Indeed, we might
            assume that everyone, at birth (or even at conception) has the potentiality for being
            aggressive or submissive, selfish or generous, cowardly or brave, masculine or feminine,
            pugnacious or peaceful, violent or gentle, and so forth, and that which of these
            potential qualities becomes actual (or to what degree it does so) depends, very largely,
            on the way in which each person is trained or on the experiences he encounters as he
            grows up. The fact that there are societies or tribes in which almost everyone is
            aggressive (like the Apaches) and that there are other closely related tribes in which
            almost everyone is submissive (like the Zuni), and the fact that infants, taken from one
            such tribe and reared in the other, grow up to have in full measure the typical
            characteristics of their adopted tribe would seem to indicate both that all such people
            are potentially about the same at conception and that their personalities are largely a
            consequence of the way in which they are reared. If this is so, it is clear that the way
            in which people are brought up is very important. This is, of course, evident from the
            consideration already mentioned; namely, that humans are helpless at birth and must be
            cared for and trained during a period of many years. The way in which they are cared for
            and trained depends very largely on the personalities of the people whom they encounter
            as they are growing up, but these personalities again depend on the way in which these
            adults were reared. Thus there appear in any society certain patterns of action, of
            belief, and of thought that are passed on from generation to generation, always slightly
            different both from generation to generation and from person to person in any single
            generation, but possessing a recognizable pattern.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This pattern depends not only on the way people are trained to act, to
            feel, and to
            think but also on the more concrete manifestations of their social environment, such as
            the kind of clothes they wear, the kind of shelters in which they live, the kind of
            tools they have for making a living, the kind of food they eat and how they eat it, the
            kind of toys they have to amuse themselves, as well as the kind of weapons they have to
            defend themselves. All of these things, patterns of action, feeling, and thought, as
            well as concrete objects used in these activities, are known in the social sciences as
            culture. This culture forms the environment in which a child grows up as the natural
            environment surrounds the baby turtle as it grows up in the sea. Man is surrounded by
            natural environment, to be sure; but it is much more remote from him than from the
            turtle, for, in man\'s case, culture intervenes as a kind of insulation between him and
            his natural environment. In fact, the surrounding environment of culture penetrates both
            into him as a person and into his natural environment, changing both. His neurological
            reactions in behavior, in feeling, and in thought are largely determined by his cultural
            environment, and at the same time this cultural environment modifies his natural
            environment by such activities as heating his home, cooking his food, cutting down
            forests, draining swamps, killing off animals, and generally modifying the face of the
            earth.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have said that the individual\'s reactions in behavior, in feeling,
            and in thought
            (what we call his personality) are largely determined by his cultural environment. At
            the same time, his personality is part of the cultural environment of those people whom
            he meets. And, as already said, only by such relationships is his personality developed
            from his human nature. All this makes a human being so different from a turtle that
            nothing very relevant to human behavior can be learned from the study of turtle
            behavior. With the turtle we are dealing with a twofold situation: the turtle and his
            environment. With the human being we are dealing with a threefold situation: the human
            being surrounded by his culture and both together surrounded by the natural environment—
            and by other cultures. Where a turtle lays dozens of eggs and hopes that some turtles
            from those eggs can be carried to maturity by obedience to fairly rigid instincts, the
            human has almost no rigid instincts, and adapts his personality to his culture. The
            culture in turn must adapt itself to the natural environment. Thus, if the natural
            environment changes, the turtle must change his nature, while man merely changes his
            culture (and thus his personality). But this beautifully flexible relationship requires
            such a long period of training and learning during which human nature becomes a human
            personality and the individual becomes able to care for himself, that humans are
            dependent upon their parents for many years. Accordingly, humans have few offspring, and
            each offspring is very valuable, since the survival of the species does not depend (as
            with turtles) on the more or less accidental survival of a very few out of the many
            reproduced, but depends instead on the ability to bring up almost all who were born and
            to train them so that they can take care of themselves, have the intelligence to modify
            their culture (including their personalities) when it becomes necessary to adapt to the
            environment, and at the same time develop the capacity to use the freedom to change
            their behavior (which this whole situation assumes) in such a way that it will be
            beneficial to themselves and to the group on which they depend for the continuation of
            their culture.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;All this leads us to certain tentative assumptions about human nature,
            about the
            nature of culture, and about the nature of human society. In regard to human nature, it
            would seem that we have to deal with two things: (a) a wide range of potentiality and
            (b) a drive to make these potentialities actual. The range of these potentialities seems
            to run a full gamut from the most concrete and material activities, such as eating or
            moving about, through a broad belt of emotional and social activities to a fairly broad
            range of spiritual and intellectual activities. It would be rash to say that this range
            of potentialities has very specific qualities or needs in it or that there are any
            intrinsic dividing lines separating one potentiality from another. A study of human
            personalities and human cultures would seem to indicate that these potentialities blur
            into one another, that each person has opposing (and even incompatible) extremes of each
            potential quality, and that there can be a good deal of substituting of one potential
            quality for another as these qualities develop into actual characteristics. Any
            divisions we may make in this gamut of human potentialities are probably arbitrary and
            imaginary. We might divide the range into two: physical and spiritual; or into three:
            physical, emotional, and intellectual; or into four (a) material needs, such as food,
            clothing, shelter; (b) sex; (c) gregarious needs, such as companionship; and (d) psychic
            needs, such as a world outlook, psychological security, or the desire to know the
            \"meaning\" of things. We could, indeed, divide this gamut into forty or into four
            hundred
            divisions or levels, since the reality with which our words seek to deal is a subtle,
            continuous, and flexible range quite beyond our ability to grasp clearly or fully. This
            range of human potentialities will sometimes be divided in this book, for purposes of
            historical analysis, into six levels, as follows: (1) military, (2) political, (3)
            economic, (4) social, (5) religious, (6) intellectual, although this division will
            always be made with the full realization that it could, with good justification, be made
            otherwise as five, seven, sixty, or six hundred levels.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This range of human potentialities is also the range of human needs
            because of man\'s
            vital drive that impels him to seek to realize his potentialities. This drive is even
            more mysterious than the potentialities it seeks to realize. Throughout history men have
            given various names to this drive, and there have been endless disputes about its names
            and about its extent and nature. The Classical Greeks, like Aristotle, sought to ignore
            it by merely assuming that everything had a purpose and that everything by its very
            nature sought to achieve its purpose. This is generally known as a teleological
            explanation (from the Greek word teleos, meaning purpose or goal). In the Christian
            Middle Ages this teleological approach was somewhat modified by the belief that, while
            everything had a purpose, things were drawn to seek to fulfill these purposes by the
            love of God. About the year 1600 men began to place this drive inside men (driving them
            on) rather than outside (drawing them on) as before 1600. Spinoza about 1670 called this
            drive the \"soul.\" About 1818 Schopenhauer called it \"will.\" About 1890 Bergson
            called it
            \"the vital urge,\" while at the same time Freud called it \"sex.\" Throughout this
            later
            period many natural scientists called it \"energy.\" Without getting into any
            controversy
            about the merits of these various terms, we can agree with them all that there does seem
            to be some force driving men to seek to realize their potentialities.

            and societies,
            let us try to sum up our conclusions regarding the divisibility of the range of human
            potentialities by the following diagram in which the distance between the line AB and
            the line CD represents this range. The various columns represent various ways in which
            it might be divided. This range as a whole we shall call \"the dimension of

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When these potentialities of human nature are realized, they become
            the
            characteristics of human personality. This is very helpful, for we cannot directly
            observe or study human nature, and are compelled to make assumptions as to what it must
            be like from our studies of human personality. Since the characteristics of human
            personality emerge from the potentialities of human nature as a result of experience and
            training, and since each person\'s experience and training are different, each
            personality is different. At the same time, since each person in the same society is
            brought up in the same culture and thus tends to have similar experiences and similar
            training, most of the persons in a society tend to have a basic personality pattern,
            with similar general characteristics either emphasized or subdued.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Not only is human personality formed by the social environment; the
            social environment
            (or culture) is largely made up of the personalities it has created. In this way culture
            is passed down from generation to generation, always somewhat changed but always largely
            the same. From this point of view culture is known as the social heritage, passing on
            from generation to generation by teaching and learning, most of it unconscious.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When a child is first trying to walk, he may fall without actually
            hurting himself.
            What happens in the next few moments may contribute considerably to the formation of his
            future personality. If an adult swoops down on him, full of sympathetic sounds and
            commiseration, he may decide that he is hurt and begin to cry. This could easily become
            one of the earliest steps toward forming a personality that reacts to the unexpected
            with self-pity. On the other hand, such a fall might lead some neighboring adult to say:
            \"Get up, Jimmy, and try again. You must be more careful and watch where you are
            going.\"
            This could easily be an early step toward self-responsibility and self-reliance.
            Frequently, after such a fall, the child, if ignored, will be frustrated and resentful.
            Struggling to his feet, he may strike out at the nearest person or at some inanimate
            object. Again the reactions of surrounding adults depend upon the personality patterns
            of the culture, and serve to mold the developing personality of the child. There are
            societies where a frustrated child who strikes at an innocent bystander might be
            admired: \"Look at that spirit; isn\'t he the little man!\" This serves to encourage the
            development of a culture based on personalities of irrational aggressions. If, on the
            other hand, a child who displays an early response of aggression to frustration is
            immediately stopped, has his hands slapped to discourage such a reaction, and is sternly
            warned: \"You fell because you were not careful and did not watch what you were doing.
            Mrs. Jones had nothing to do with your fall, so don\'t you dare strike at her . . . ,\"
            in
            such a case the child\'s personality will be turned from aggression to
            self-responsibility.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Episodes such as this occur many times a day in every society. When
            they occur, the
            people involved react to them in accordance with their own personality structures. Few
            of the persons involved in such a situation stop to think that they are involved in a
            teaching situation and are helping to mold the society of the future by helping to mold
            the personality of one of its members. In highly integrated societies, such as most
            primitive tribes, the outcome of each such episode as this will be similar because the
            adults involved have similar personality structures and, as a consequence, the children
            growing up, who occasion such incidents, will experience similar reactions and will
            themselves develop similar personality structures, whatever these may be. In a more
            complex and more disintegrated society, such as our own, the personality structures of
            adults are already so varied that it is difficult to say how they would react to the
            event we have described. Thus quite different reactions might occur, and the children
            who are at the center of these episodes, by experiencing different reactions will grow
            up with different personalities, thus continuing and probably increasing the
            disintegration of the society\'s behavior patterns. There can be no doubt that we could
            have predicted the social response to any act of childish aggression a century or more
            ago with some assurance: the child would have been punished. But today it would be
            impossible to guess what might happen; and, just as the possible reactions have become
            more varied, so the personalities developed from such reactions have become more diverse
            and the society itself has become less integrated.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The culture of a society consists of much more than the personalities
            of the people in
            the society. It consists of all the material things they use, such as the dwellings,
            tools, and clothing already mentioned. It consists of patterns of action, feeling, and
            thought. It consists of established social relationships between one person and another
            as well as between persons and objects. It consists of all kinds of fine, subtle, and
            changeable interrelationships between people and between groups, relationships and
            feelings that are sometimes obvious but are frequently unobserved, reactions that are so
            long established (and thus so \"natural\") that they are neither noticed nor questioned.
            Each individual in a society is a nexus where innumerable relationships of this
            character intersect. Taken as a whole, these innumerable relationships (many of them
            deeply imbedded in his neurological system) form a status, which was slowly created as
            he grew up and will be abruptly destroyed when he dies. The gap created in the fabric of
            society by the death of an individual is slowly closed as some of the ruptured
            relationships are healed over; many others are taken up by different persons; and the
            many social functions that formed the previous status are taken over by a number of
            quite separate persons.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Culture is thus a very subtle and very complex thing. From our point
            of view it is the
            cushion between man\'s purely animal nature and the natural environment. From another
            point of view it is the social heritage passed down from generation to generation. From
            another point of view it is a complex medley of personalities, material objects,
            patterns of behavior, subtle emotional relationships, accepted intellectual ideas and
            intellectual assumptions, and customary individual actions. From any point of view it is
            constantly changing, and forms the chief subject of study in all the social sciences.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This culture is both adaptive and persistent. It is adaptive because
            it is able to
            change, and it is persistent because it will not change without cause. The causes of
            such social change are both internal and external to the culture. They include the
            geographic, the biologic, and the cultural environment. The geographic environment
            includes such things as terrain and climate. Obviously, culture must adapt itself to
            these; consequently, the Eskimos have quite a different culture from the Arabs of the
            desert or the jungle Negroes. And it is equally clear that as geographic conditions
            change, cultures must change too. When all of Europe was under glacial conditions, the
            cultures there must have been different from what they became when all of Europe was
            under thick forests (about 8000 B.C.) or under temperate conditions (about 1000 B.C.).
            The cultures in Europe adapted themselves to these changes.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Similarly, culture adapts itself to changing biologic conditions. When
            the herring
            swarmed in the North Sea in the late Middle Ages or the buffalo swarmed on the North
            American plains in the early nineteenth century, the people living in these areas had
            cultures adapted to these conditions. But when the herring disappeared or the buffalo
            were largely exterminated, the people of northern Europe or the Indians of the Great
            Plains had to adapt their cultures to such changing biologic environment.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In a similar fashion, but to a much greater degree, cultures must
            adapt themselves to
            changing cultural environments. These latter include the culture itself as well as other
            different cultures. When a culture changes because one part of it must adapt itself to a
            different part of the same culture, we say that it is self-adaptive. Thus, when a
            culture gets a different weapon (as when the Indians on the Great Plains obtained the
            horse after 1543 or obtained guns after about 1780), the religious, intellectual,
            social, economic, political, and military aspects of the culture are changed by this new
            acquisition. At the same time a culture must adapt itself to other cultures, as the
            culture of Western civilization has to adapt itself to the culture of Soviet Russia or
            as the people of Tahiti or the people of China had to adapt their cultures to the
            culture of Western civilization during the nineteenth century. When a culture is not
            able to adapt itself to changes in its geographic, biologic, or cultural environment, it
            may perish, just as the cultures of the American Indians or the culture of the ancient
            Carthaginians perished when these peoples were unable to adapt themselves to the impact
            of Western civilization or to that of Classical civilization. It is worth noting that
            when animals (like the dinosaurs) are incapable of adapting their physical structure to
            changes in the environment, the species perishes; but man (who has the insulation of
            culture between his physical structure and his environment) merely undergoes destruction
            of his culture instead of destruction of his species when his culture cannot adapt
            itself to changes in the environment.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It sometimes happens that a culture is unable to adapt itself to
            changes in part of
            itself. For example, a change in weapons (which is part of culture) may be so drastic
            (like the atom bomb) that the other parts of the same culture, such as the economic and
            political systems, cannot adapt themselves to this military change and the culture will
            perish. This means that cultural changes are not necessarily progressive, but are
            frequently irrational, retrogressive, and destructive. A culture may even commit
            suicide. For example, at a remote period the culture of the Aztec people in Mexico
            changed on the religious level by the introduction of human sacrifices to one of their
            gods. The military level adapted itself to this religious change by changing its tactics
            from an effort to kill the enemy to an effort to capture the enemy (so that captives
            could be used as religious sacrifices). This change injured the culture\'s ability to
            defend itself because the Aztecs no longer fought to defend themselves or to kill their
            enemies, but fought to capture them for sacrifices. When the Spaniards under Hernando
            Cortez arrived in Mexico in 1519, the Aztec defense was much hampered by the fact that
            they were fighting to capture while the Spaniards were fighting to kill.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because culture is adaptive to itself, it is integrative; but, because
            it is also
            adaptive to diverse external influences as well as to the human drive to realize human
            potentialities, no culture ever becomes integrated. By \"integrative\" we mean that the
            different parts of a culture adapt themselves to one another and tend to become
            increasingly an interlocking unified system in which each part fits snugly into all the
            surrounding parts. But this result is never reached, for, at the very moment that one
            part of culture is adapting itself to another part to become more closely fitted to it,
            it is becoming less adapted to some third part which is also changing under influences
            from some other source. Thus no culture ever becomes integrated. This is a good thing,
            because a fully integrated culture would be rigid and would resist change so completely
            that it would become incapable of adapting itself to changes in its external environment
            on the one side and incapable of fulfilling man\'s drive to realize his potentialities
            on
            the other side. A fully integrated culture would be like the dinosaurs, which had to
            perish because they were no longer able to adapt themselves to changes in the external
            environment. Accordingly, culture is made up of loose-fitting parts that are only
            partially adapted to one another, to the environment, and to human needs, and are
            constantly changing in response to shifting pressures from these three directions. It is
            able to survive just because it is not rigidly integrated.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;So far, we have spoken about culture. This is the part of reality with
            which history
            is concerned, but it is only part of the whole picture that historians must examine. The
            rest of this picture is made up of the persons whose activities created the culture. It
            must always be remembered that culture is the consequence of persons seeking to realize
            their potentialities sufficiently to satisfy their inner drives. Without human beings
            there would be no culture. It is equally true that without culture there would be no
            humans (but only animals, in direct contact with their natural environment). The whole
            combination of human beings plus their culture we call by various names such as
            societies, social groups, or even civilizations. These terms have different meanings
            that we shall examine in a moment. Before we do, we should sum up the stage we have
            reached in our discussion.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We could write our last conclusion as an equation, thus: Society =
            Humans + Culture.
            The society is surrounded by its natural environment to which it adapts itself by
            changes in its culture. Thus the whole relationship might be represented by a diagram:

            in the equation
            just given) are misleading, because culture is not rigidly separated from the human
            beings on the one hand and from the environment on the other. Rather it penetrates into
            both. In fact, much of culture is inside human beings because it takes the form of
            trained neurological reactions, developed muscles, emotional reactions, ideas both clear
            and vague, and the established patterns of acting that make the difference between human
            personality and human nature. Human personality is the part of culture that is inside
            human beings and can be observed. Also inside human beings, but beyond the limits of our
            observation, is human nature. Such human nature is made up of potentialities and the
            drive (or drives) to express these. What these potentialities or drives are we cannot

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In addition to personality (which is inside human beings), culture has
            manifestations
            outside human beings. This external culture consists of networks of human relationships,
            of concrete tools and instruments (called artifacts), and of symbols for communication
            or expression.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In order to develop their potentialities so that human personalities
            emerge from
            latent human nature, human beings establish relationships with one another. As the child
            develops, these relationships are extended from such fundamental relationships as those
            with mother and nurse to those with parents, siblings, and teachers, to those with
            friends, with the opposite sex, with business relations, with representatives of the
            government (like the police, the tax collector, and the draftboard), and with one\'s
            fellow citizens and fellow soldiers. All these relationships, as part of culture, form
            groups of human beings. Of these groups there are many different kinds. We shall
            distinguish four different kinds at this point: (1) social groups, (2) societies, (3)
            producing societies, and (4) civilizations. All are made up of aggregates of human
            beings with their personalities and external culture.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The social sciences are usually concerned with groups of persons
            rather than with
            individual persons. The behavior of individuals, being free, is unpredictable. There is
            more hope of success when we deal with the activities of aggregates of persons because
            in such aggregates the unpredictable behaviors of individuals tend to cancel each other
            out and become submerged in the behavior of the group as a whole. While the behavior of
            such a group may not be predictable, it is less free to change and can, accordingly, be
            extrapolated in a way that individual behavior does not allow. The same situation exists
            in the physical sciences, where we are quite unable to predict the behavior of any
            individual molecule or particle, but can, with assurance, predict the changes that take
            place in any large aggregate of molecules. These relationships, in the physical
            sciences, can be stated in the form of \"laws\" concerning the pressure, volume, size,
            state, and temperature of aggregates of molecules.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;With aggregates of persons we can state no laws comparable to those
            found in the
            physical sciences, although we can point out tendencies. For example, if an aggregate of
            persons in a stable group undergoes a rise in standards of living we can expect a
            tendency toward an increase in population for the group as a whole, even when we cannot
            say of any individual in the group that he will have more children or even any children
            at all. Moreover, we can study the nature and distribution of the increased supply of
            wealth to determine its effects on the numbers of children in various subgroups within
            the main group. But in the social sciences, where we must be satisfied with tendencies
            rather than with laws, we can analyze the working out of such influences and tendencies
            only if we have a fairly clear idea of the nature and structure of the social groupings
            involved. This is quite different from the natural sciences where laws about the
            behavior of aggregates could be made long before men had any clear idea of how such
            aggregates were made up.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The statement that we can enunciate rules of social tendencies only if
            we have fairly
            clear ideas about the nature of social groupings makes it necessary for us to confess
            that the nature of groups is one of the matters on which there has been wide
            disagreement in the past. In general men\'s ideas on this subject could be placed in
            three classes: (1) those who believed that social groups were merely collections; (2)
            those who believed that social groups were organisms; and (3) those who denied that
            social groups were either collections or organisms but argued that they were sui
            generis, a particular kind of aggregate of their own.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The distinctions between these three points of view on the nature of
            social aggregates
            could be expressed roughly as follows. A collection is no more than the sum of its
            parts, and the parts are interchangeable within the collection. An organism is more than
            the sum of its parts (since they have patterns of relationships), and the parts, being
            fitted to their position and role in the whole, are not interchangeable. The third
            class, made up of those who maintain that a social group is sui generis, occupy a middle
            ground between the \"collectionists\" and the \"organicists\" since they say that the
            whole
            is more than the sum of its parts but that the parts (that is, the individuals in the
            group) are interchangeable in their functions and positions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A discussion such as this about the nature of social groups may seem
            to be a merely
            academic dispute of little practical significance, but, as a matter of fact, it has been
            profoundly significant throughout human history. Those who have seen human groups as
            organisms, from the ancient Greeks to Hitler, have derived from this point of view
            certain corollaries about the relations of the individual to the group that have been
            destructive of individualism and of human liberties. For in an organism the parts exist
            for the sake of the whole and are subordinate to it; they must be sacrificed if
            necessary for the welfare of the whole. Thus Aristotle says that a man cannot live apart
            from the state, as an animal could or a god could, because a man cut off from the state
            is like a thumb cut off from a hand: it is no longer a thumb but merely looks like a
            thumb. In saying this he is using an organic analogy which explains the totalitarian
            character of the Greek polis or of the later Roman imperium. Both were as prepared to
            sacrifice the individual to the state as we would be to cut off a cancerous thumb in
            order to save the whole organism.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;On the other hand, the argument that a social group is only a
            collection and thus
            simply an aggregate of individuals with no established patterns of relationships and
            with no aims or purposes beyond those of the individuals who make it up is equally
            pernicious of human values. For a collection can have no established traditions or any
            purposes of its own and can expect no spirit of sacrifice or of public service from its
            members; instead, it must expect its members to be as competitive in their relations
            with one another as they would be toward any member of an outside group.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The middle ground that regards a social group as an aggregate of its
            own distinctive
            type avoids the difficulties both of totalitarian organicism and of the rampant
            individualism of the collectionists. Because of their belief that the whole has pattern,
            and thus is more than a mere aggregation of individuals, holders of the middle ground
            are able to preserve social tradition and to encourage devotion to the whole as an
            entity with its own distinctive values; but by their insistence that individuals are
            interchangeable within the whole they are able to protect the ultimate value of the
            individual and to infer that the whole exists for the sake of the individual, and not
            the opposite, providing him with opportunities to develop his higher potentialities
            through social cooperation in a way that would not be possible in a mere collection of
            individuals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From centuries of argument on these matters there has begun to emerge
            a sufficient
            consensus for us to say that students of the social sciences today tend to avoid either
            of the extreme positions of organicism or individualism and tend to agree that social
            groups are aggregates of a special kind subject to their own rules and characteristics.
            Accordingly we must seek to define a social group and to show the various types of these
            that can exist. There are three basic types of such social aggregates: (1) social
            groups, (2) societies, and (3) civilizations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A social group is an aggregate of persons who have had relationships
            with one another
            long enough for these to have become customary, and for them to come to regard
            themselves as a unit with well-defined limits. The essential thing about a group is that
            its members can say who is in it and who is not. The term covers such aggregates as a
            class in history, a football team, a fraternity, a university, a business concern, a
            parish or church, a political party or a state. All these groups come into existence
            gradually as relationships are established and mutual recognition grows. When a class in
            history or a football squad assembles for the first time, it is not a group, but simply
            an aggregate of persons, and the group comes into existence only gradually. In fact, it
            continues to develop as long as it is of any social significance.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A society is a group whose members have more relationships with one
            another than they
            do with outsiders. As a result, a society forms an integrative unity and is
            comprehensible. It is the vehicle of the culture we were talking about before. A society
            has a culture because it is a unity, and it is a unity because its members have more
            relationships with one another than with outsiders. A group does not have any culture of
            its own; the culture of a group is the culture of the society in which the group is. By
            some stretching of the use of words, the personalities of the members of a group might
            be regarded as the culture of the group; but culture consists of more than personalities
            (since it also includes external culture), and the personalities of any group have more
            relationships with people who are outside the group than with people inside the group,
            if for no other reason than the fact that these personalities developed by means of
            relationships with outsiders long before these personalities joined the group. If this
            were not true, and the personalities of the members of the group had been developed by
            means of relationships within the group, then this aggregate of which we are speaking is
            a society and not a group.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is sometimes difficult for some people to distinguish between a
            group and a society
            because they fail to see the most fundamental relationships among people. It is
            frequently helpful to think of some of the varied relationships that can exist among
            people. If this is done, it becomes clear that the Zuni Indians or the Japanese about
            1850 were societies, but that a history class, a football team, or a corporation is a
            group. The Zuni or the Japanese were societies because they had their religious,
            intellectual, social, economic, and political relations with other members of the same
            group. The members of a class, of a football team, or of a corporation have most of
            these relationships with outsiders. Members of such a group have their religious
            relationships with the whole Christian tradition, while their intellectual relationships
            are with the whole tradition of Western culture; their social relationships are with
            outsiders to the group, such as parents, sweethearts, or friends; their economic
            relationships are with the whole capitalist economic world and beyond (for example, they
            drink coffee for breakfast); and their political relationships are with all their fellow
            citizens and even outside that. In such a wide flung nexus of relationships, the
            relatively narrow range of mutual relationships possessed by members of the same class,
            the same team, or the same corporation shows clearly that these latter are groups and
            not societies.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The real problem in distinguishing between groups and societies arises
            when we look at
            modern political units like the state or nation. Most states, such as Canada, France,
            Italy, Cuba, or the United States, are not societies but groups because their members\'
            relationships with one another are only political and social, while their religious,
            intellectual, and economic relationships are in a much wider context. The religious
            ideas of people in the countries mentioned are expressed in terms of monotheism, the
            Christian ethical and doctrinal systems, the deity as a masculine being located in the
            sky, and so forth. There is nothing specifically Canadian, French, or American in these
            ideas. On the other hand, they are quite different from the religious ideas of peoples
            in a different society. These latter might be expressed in terms of a female deity
            residing within the earth, or of nonhuman shape, or demanding human sacrifice, and so
            on. Similarly, the eating patterns of peoples in all the countries mentioned are very
            similar: they cook their food, eat bread made from wheat, drink coffee, prefer steaks,
            and are rather unlikely to be found eating raw blubber or fried locusts. Similarly, they
            all trace family descent through the father, practice monogamy, have private property,
            seek profits, accept the scientific tradition, use explosives as weapons, and so on.
            These similarities are so much more numerous and so much more important than the
            dissimilarities between these countries that the personality patterns and the general
            outlook on the universe that bind these people together into a single system of
            relationships make them have more relationships with one another across political
            frontiers than they do with members of any single group within such frontiers. The fact
            that Canadians have more relationships outside Canada than inside it means that Canada
            could not be understood or even described without using terms like Christian,
            scientific, industrial, monogamous, nationalism, Protestant, capitalism, parliament,
            democracy, railroads, rifles, ballots, radioactivity, and such. None of these terms, nor
            the things which they represent, is of Canadian origin nor can they be understood in
            purely Canadian terms. The need to use them in describing Canada means that Canada can
            be understood only as part of the larger system from which these words (and the objects
            they represent) arise. This large system is, as we shall see, Western civilization;
            Canada can only be understood as a political group within Western culture.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This distinction between groups and societies (with the former defined
            as an aggregate
            whose members have more relationships with outsiders than with one another) means that a
            society is a comprehensible unit, while a group is not a comprehensible unit. A group
            can be known but it cannot be comprehended, because comprehension involves knowledge of
            a major part of the relationships existing in an aggregate. Such knowledge is not
            possible within a group because many of the relationships of the members of a group go
            outside the group to members of the larger unit, the society, of which the group is a
            part.

            itself. Indeed, it is a safe rule that no significant questions about anything inside a
            group can be answered except by reference to things outside the group.

            Fortune arrived among the Dobu, B. Malinowski among the Trobriand Islanders, Captain
            Cook among the Polynesians, Pizarro among the Incas, or Marco Polo among the Chinese, it
            is possible to obtain explanations and understanding of what is going on if there are

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since a society is comprehensible, while a group is not, most
            political units (being
            groups) are not comprehensible units. Political units are comprehensible only when a
            single political unit covers the whole of a society. This is frequently not the case,
            although it is usually true of the more primitive societies organized in tribes. The
            Zuni, for example, like many of the other Indian tribes, were both a political unit and
            a society. Japan and China were, about 1850, comprehensible political units because they
            were separate societies. In most advanced societies it will be found that the religious,
            intellectual, social, economic, and even military patterns are roughly coterminous with
            each other and with the outline of the society as a whole. But in such a society the
            political units usually cut across these other patterns. We can know a great deal about
            such political units, but we cannot understand them because understanding requires
            knowledge of a major portion of the patterns of relationships in society as a whole.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As we examine numerous societies like that of the Eskimos, the Zuni
            Indians, the
            Chinese, the Hottentots, or our own Western civilization, we see that there are two
            different kinds of such societies: (a) parasitic societies and (b) producing societies.
            The former are those which live from hunting, fishing, or merely gleaning. By their
            economic activities they do not increase, but rather decrease, the amount of wealth in
            the world. The second kind of societies, producing societies, lives by agricultural and
            pastoral activities. By these activities they seek to increase the amount of wealth in
            the world. As we shall see later, the distinction between these two kinds of societies
            is of most fundamental importance. Man was a parasite from his first appearance on the
            earth, perhaps as long as a million years ago. Only with the discovery of the techniques
            of agriculture and domestication less than ten thousand years ago did it become possible
            for man to be a producer, and, even during the last ten thousand years, there have been
            more parasitic societies (like the Sioux or the Eskimos) than there have been producing
            societies (like the Zuni or the Chinese).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If we concentrate our attention on the producing societies that have
            existed during
            the last ten thousand years, we see again that there are at least two distinct kinds.
            There are simple producing societies like the Zuni (with agriculture), or the Masai
            (with pastoral herds), and there are much more complex societies that we call
            \"civilizations\" (like the Chinese, the Aztecs, or ourselves). The distinction between
            a
            civilization and an ordinary producing society is not easy to draw, and it is too early
            in our discussion to seek to draw it at this time. However, it is clear that most of the
            civilizations with which we are familiar have had both writing and city life.
            Accordingly, as a temporary definition, we might say that a civilization is a producing
            society that has writing and city life.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might sum up our definitions to this point by saying that
            aggregates of persons may
            be divided into (a) collections, (b) groups, or (c) societies. The members of a
            collection, coming casually together in time and place, have no established
            relationships. The members of a group do have relationships sufficiently established to
            be able to identify who is or who is not a member of the group, but they have the major
            portion of their total relationships with persons who are not members of the group. A
            society, on the other hand, is made up of persons who have the major part of their
            relationships with one another. It may be either parasitic or producing, and if it is a
            producing society it may or may not be a civilization. These rather simple but very
            significant distinctions can be summed up in a table:

            smaller number of producing societies, and very few civilizations. As for the relative
            numbers of each, we might say that there have been hundreds of thousands of the first,
            at least thousands of the second, but not more than two dozen civilizations. Since our
            chief concern in this book is with our own society, which is a civilization, the rest of
            this book will be concerned with the nature of this particular kind of society only.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Of the two dozen civilizations, all of which existed during the last
            ten thousand
            years, seven have been alive in recent years, while the rest, amounting to approximately
            seventeen in number, lived and died long ago. All of them, both living and dead, can be
            divided into three groups depending upon the carbohydrate plant they produced as an
            energy food. There were three such foods: maize, rice, and grain (wheat and barley). In
            the maize group were two civilizations: (a) the Andean civilization, which began about
            1500 B.C., culminated in the Inca Empire, and was destroyed by outside invaders about
            A.D. 1600; (b) the Mesoamerican civilization, which began about 1000 B.C., culminated in
            the Aztec Empire, and was destroyed by similar invaders about A.D. 1550. Both of these
            civilizations were derived from a common source, a producing society which was not a
            civilization, probably situated in some hilly area in the northern part of South
            America.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The \"rice\" group is somewhat misnamed since the chief carbohydrates
            which supported it
            in the earliest period and have continued to be used since were millet and wheat. This
            group has at least three (and perhaps as many as six) civilizations in it. Only an
            expert on the history of the Far East could speak with confidence on this subject. Since
            this is not one of our chief areas of interest, we shall oversimplify the situation by
            listing no more than three civilizations. Of these the earliest, Sinic civilization,
            rose in the valley of the Yellow River after 2000 B.C., culminated in the Chin and Han
            empires after 250 B.C., and was largely disrupted by Ural-Altaic invaders after A.D.
            400. From the debris of this Sinic civilization there emerged two other civilizations:
            (a) Chinese civilization, which began about A.D. 400, culminated in the Manchu Empire
            after 1644, and was destroyed by European intruders in the period 1790-1930; and (b)
            Japanese civilization, which began about the time of Christ or a little earlier,
            culminated in the Tokugawa Empire after 1600, and may have been completely disrupted by
            Western intruders in the century following 1853.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The earliest civilizations are to be found neither in the maize group
            nor in the rice
            group, but in the much more important group of \"grain civilizations.\" This group is
            more
            important not only because it contains the first civilizations to come into existence
            but also because it contains such a large number of civilizations, seventeen at least.
            The earliest civilizations were derived from a number of closely related producing
            societies that we shall call the Neolithic Garden cultures, or, less accurately, the
            Painted Pottery Peoples. The latter were the first peoples to have agriculture, and thus
            formed the earliest producing societies in history. At the risk of considerable
            oversimplification, we might say that these earliest agriculturalists appeared in the
            hilly terrain of western Asia, probably not far from Armenia, about nine thousand years
            ago. Because they knew nothing about replenishing the fertility of the soil, they
            practiced \"shifting cultivation,\" moving to new fields when yields declined in their
            old
            fields. In consequence, they expanded steadily, reaching Denmark and Britain in the west
            and China in the east before 2000 B.C., that is to say, within five thousand years. In
            the course of this movement they found, in various alluvial river valleys, sites adapted
            to permanent large-scale settlement because, in such valleys, the annual flood
            replenished the fertility of the soil by depositing a layer of fertile sediment; and,
            accordingly, the need for \"shifting cultivation\" ended and the possibility of
            permanent,
            eventually urban, settlements was offered. This possibility was realized in four
            alluvial valleys of the Old World, in Mesopotamia during the sixth millennium B.C., in
            the valley of the Nile shortly afterward, in the valley of the Indus River early in the
            fourth millennium B.C., and in the Huang Ho Valley of China late in the third millennium
            B.C. The last of these has already been mentioned as the source of the Sinic
            civilization, which was the parent of the Chinese, Japanese, and probably other Far
            Eastern civilizations.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The first civilization, known to us as the Sumerian or Mesopotamian
            civilization,
            began after 6000 B.C., reached a peak of achievement about 1700 B.C., and ended in a
            series of empires of which the last was the Persian. That empire and the civilization of
            which it was the political aspect were destroyed by outside invaders, the Greeks under
            Alexander the Great, after the end of the fourth century. Parallel with this, a quite
            different civilization in the Nile Valley reached its peak about 2300 B.C., established
            its greatest geographic extent as the Egyptian Empire a millennium later, and was
            destroyed by the same Greek invaders in the few generations following 330 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;While this was going on, other civilizations appeared, flourished,
            culminated in their
            respective empires, and perished at the hands of outside invaders in a strikingly
            similar process. In the Indus Valley the Indie civilization began about 3500 B.C.,
            reached a peak of achievement about 2200 B.C., culminated in a political empire that we
            might call the Harappa Empire, and was destroyed by the Aryan invaders who came into the
            Indian subcontinent from the northwest after 1700 B.C. From the wreckage of this
            culture, there was constructed a quite distinct civilization, which we may call Hindu.
            This reached a peak of achievement about 100 B.C., and culminated in a series of empires
            of which the last, called the Mogul Empire, was established early in the sixteenth
            century. This empire and the civilization of which it formed a part were destroyed by
            European invaders in the centuries following 1700. From the wreckage of this Hindu
            civilization a new civilization seems to be coming into existence in our own time.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Returning to the Nearer East we can see that a number of different
            civilizations
            appeared there, largely from Mesopotamian inspiration. On the island of Crete the
            earliest civilization outside an alluvial valley began to form toward the end of the
            fourth millennium B.C. It reached its peak in the Minoan period, about 1500 B.C., and
            ended with the Mycenaean Empire, destroyed by the Dorian invaders in the twelfth century
            B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Anatolia, in the second millennium B.C., rose and fell the
            shortest-lived of all
            civilizations. Known as the Hittite civilization, this had its beginnings after 2000
            B.C., reached its widest imperial extent about 1300, and perished a few generations
            later from the onslaughts of invading Iron Age intruders, cousins of the Dorians who
            were simultaneously destroying Cretan civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the Levant, during the same period, there appeared, under
            Mesopotamian stimulus, a
            civilization we might call Canaanite. Beginning before 2000 B.C., it reached its
            greatest extent, from the Red Sea to Spain, about 900 B.C., and ended with that empire
            which, called Punic by the Romans and Carthaginian by us, was known to themselves, more
            accurately, as Canaanite. It perished from Roman invasion before 100 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From the wreckage of Cretan civilization there began to grow, about
            1000 B.C., a new
            civilization with which we are well acquainted. Known as Classical civilization, or
            Mediterranean civilization from the sea whose shores it occupied, it reached its
            greatest peak in the century divided at 400 B.C., and finally culminated in the Roman
            Empire. It was destroyed, as is generally known, by the Germanic \"barbarian invaders\"
            in
            the fifth century of our era. From its wreckage emerged three civilizations: (a) Western
            civilization, which may culminate in an American empire; (b) Orthodox civilization,
            which seems to be culminating in the Soviet empire; and (c) Islamic civilization, which
            did culminate in the Ottoman Empire, and was disrupted by intruders from Western
            civilization in the first half of the present century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In this enumeration we have named sixteen civilizations. Of these, two
            existed in the
            New World, three in the Far East, one in Africa, and the others in the rest of Eurasia.
            With careful study it would be possible to distinguish approximately eight more
            civilizations divided about equally between the Near East and the Far East. We refrain
            from attempting to do this because the facts are not clear and any conclusions would be
            disputable. The Near East and the Far East in the history of civilizations are like
            complex masses of quartz from which numerous crystals protrude in various directions.
            The number of crystals in the mass might be disputed, and there would surely be
            disagreement about which portions of the main mass of quartz should be attributed to
            each crystal. It is possible that detailed study of the problem, like microscopic
            examination of the quartz, might help to solve this problem, but for our purpose the
            task is not worth the effort. Just as it is possible for adjacent molecules in the
            quartz mass to be oriented in diverse directions so that they should, perhaps, be
            attributed to different crystals, so it is possible (and indeed is well established)
            that individual persons living next to each other in, let us say, Palestine in the
            thirteenth century B.C., should from their personal orientations be attributed to
            Hittite civilization or to Egyptian civilization or to Canaanite civilization or even to
            Mesopotamian civilization. Such attribution of individuals to civilizations is no matter
            of any historical significance and need not concern us here. Nor need we worry, at this
            time, about the eight or more additional civilizations that have existed at various
            times in Ethiopia, Cambodia, Indonesia, or Tibet. Let us study the nature of
            civilizations, as a scientist would study the nature of crystals, by examining the more
            clearly demarked and less controversial examples of our subject.

            World, we can
            arrange the fourteen Old World civilizations into a pattern to show their chief cultural
            connections. Many other connections, which we do not show on the diagram, exist in fact
            and can be inserted by the cognizant reader. It is to be noted that four of the early
            civilizations are cultural descendants of the Neolithic Garden cultures, which were not
            themselves civilizations (since they lacked both writing and city life):

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already mentioned our belief that civilization is an object
            that can be
            studied in a scientific way just as a quartz crystal can be studied. In such a study we
            must, like the student of crystals, examine in a comparative way a large number of
            examples—even, ideally, all the examples available. But it is obvious that a
            civilization is a much more complicated object than a crystal. Let us be explicit about
            that word \"complicated.\" A civilization is complicated, in the first place, because it
            is dynamic; that is, it is constantly changing in the passage of time, until it has
            perished. Furthermore, a civilization is part of the social sciences; that is, it
            contains subjective elements, and these are usually the more important elements in the
            culture. Accordingly, in a civilization, unlike a crystal, what people think or feel can
            influence what exists, changing the object completely in the process. In the third
            place, many aspects of a civilization are continua, existing in such subtle gradations
            and in such varied degrees of abstractness that the divisions we make in it, in the
            course of our analysis, and the words we use as symbols to refer to our analytical
            divisions reflect only very roughly the situation that exists in the reality itself. All
            three of these difficulties are important, but the third, which is frequently ignored in
            discussions of these matters, requires little further examination—for that reason, at
            least.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Much, if not all, of the physical world consists of continua. To say
            this is
            equivalent to saying that much of the physical world is irrational. It exists and it
            operates, but it does these things in ways that cannot be grasped by our conscious
            rational mental processes. This can be seen most easily if we consider first a few
            examples of continua in the physical world.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;How many colors are there in a rainbow? Some answer three—red, yellow,
            blue. Others
            answer six—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. When I was a child in school, for
            some unknown reason, we were told that there were seven colors, the teacher inserting
            \"indigo\" between blue and violet. The proper answer, of course, is that the number of
            colors in the rainbow is infinite. This in itself is something we cannot grasp in any
            rational way. But let us consider what it means.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the first place it means that there is, in the rainbow, no real
            line of division
            between any two colors. If we wish to draw a line we may do so, but we must recognize
            that such a line is imaginary—it may exist in our minds, but it does not exist in the
            rainbow itself.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Moreover, any line that we draw is arbitrary, in the sense that it
            could have been
            drawn with just as much justification somewhere else, perhaps only a hairbreadth away.
            If we draw a line between red and orange and another between orange and yellow, we may
            call the gamut between those two lines orange, but, as a matter of fact, the color is
            quite different on either edge of that gamut. We may decide that orange is a narrower
            range than the gamut between our two lines and, accordingly, slice off the margins of
            the orange gamut, calling the severed margin on one side yellow-orange and the severed
            margin on the other side red-orange. But once again the color is not the same across any
            of these three ranges. In fact, it is impossible to cut off any gamut in a rainbow, no
            matter how narrow we make it, in which the color is the same across the width of the
            gamut. We can move no distance, however infinitesimally small it may be, across the
            rainbow without a change in color. This means that the number of colors in the rainbow
            is infinite. But it also means that the number of colors in any portion of the rainbow
            is infinite. That is, there are as many shades of orange as there are colors in the
            whole rainbow, since both are infinite. Now, this is a truth that we cannot understand
            rationally. It seems contrary to logic and reason that we could add all the existing
            shades of red and yellow to all the existing varieties of orange without increasing the
            number of color varieties we have. The reason is not so much that infinity added to
            infinity gives infinity as that there are no different varieties of colors at all,
            because there are, in fact, no dividing lines in the rainbow itself. When we use the
            plural terms \"colors\" and \"shades\" in reference to a rainbow, we are implying that
            there
            are different colors and accordingly that there are divisions in the rainbow somehow
            separating one shade from another and thus entitling us to speak of these in the plural.
            Since there are no such lines of separation, we would be more accurate if we spoke of
            the rainbow in the singular as \"a continuum of color.\" But, of course, we could not do
            this consistently because it would make it impossible to think about or to talk about
            the colors of any objects. Since the continuum changes across its range, it is
            distinctly different in color from one portion to another, just as dresses, flowers, or
            neckties are different in color from one another. If we are going to talk about these
            very real differences, we must have different words for the different colors involved.
            Thus we must give different color terms to different portions of the rainbow\'s gamut.
            The important truth to remember is that, while the differences between colors are real
            enough, there are no real divisions between colors: these are arbitrary and imaginary.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As is well known, the gamut of radiations of visible light that we
            call the rainbow is
            not an entity in itself but is an arbitrary and imaginary portion cut out of a much
            wider gamut of electromagnetic radiations. The variety of colors in the rainbow arises
            from the fact that the radiations of visible light come at us in wave lengths of
            different frequency. As the wave lengths of these radiant forms of energy get smaller
            (and thus their frequency gets larger), we observe this difference as a shift in color
            toward the blue end of the visible spectrum; as the wave lengths get longer (and the
            frequency less), we observe a color shift toward the red end of the spectrum. If this
            shift of wave length continues, the radiation may pass beyond the range to which our
            eyes are sensitive. Beyond the red we can notice these radiations as heat (infrared);
            beyond the violet we might have difficulty noticing the radiations directly, but their
            consequence would soon appear as a kind of sunburn on our skin. Once again there is no
            dividing line between the visible gamut of radiations and the ultraviolet on one side
            and the infrared on the other side. Some persons can \"see\" further into these than
            others can, and other forms of living creatures can \"see\" further into one or the
            other
            range than any human could. Bees, for example, are fully sensitive to ultraviolet
            radiations, while humans are generally so insensitive to these that they consider glass
            windows, which cut off most ultraviolet, as being fully transparent.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The gamut of radiant energy is much wider than the three subgamuts we
            have mentioned.
            Beyond the invisible ultraviolet are other radiations of even shorter wave length,
            including soft X rays, hard X rays, and finally the very high frequency gamma waves
            released by nuclear explosions. Going the other way in the radiation range, we find that
            there are radiations of increasing wave length beyond the infrared which we call heat.
            These radiations of lower frequency and longer wave length include those used to carry
            our radio and television broadcasts. While we sit here reading, quite unaware of their
            passage, these radiations are going through our bodies. They are different from the
            visible light that allows us to see to read only in the wave lengths and energy content
            of the radiations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This great gamut or range of energy radiations, from the shortest
            gamma waves at one
            end to the longest broadcast waves at the other end, forms a continuum. The difference
            between a deadly gamma radiation and an enjoyable television broadcast, like the
            difference between red and blue, is a very real difference, but it is only a difference
            of wave length (and thus a difference of distance) and not a difference of kind.
            Accordingly, no real lines of demarcation exist in the gamut itself, and the whole range
            forms a single continuum.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The quality of being a continuum that exists in the range of
            electromagnetic
            radiations is not a quality that has anything to do with energy or with radiations, but
            is true simply because these radiations exist in space and differ from one another
            because of space distinctions, namely, their wave lengths. This spectrum is a continuum,
            and therefore irrational, because space is a continuum, and therefore irrational.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The irrationality of space sounds a little strange to most of us
            because we are so
            familiar with space that we rarely stop to think that we do not really understand it.
            But the irrational quality of space (which arises from the fact that space is infinitely
            divisible) is one of the early discoveries of ancient intellectual history. By 2000 B.C.
            the Babylonians were familiar with the fact that the square of the hypotenuse of a
            right-angle triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
            Introduced to the Greeks in a generalized form by Pythagoras before 500 B.C., this
            statement came to be called the \"Pythagorean theorem.\" Unfortunately, Pythagoras also
            taught that reality was rational and that the truth can be found by the use of reason
            and logic alone, without any need for observation through the senses, which would merely
            serve to confuse us. This rationalist method for discovering the nature of reality was
            accepted by Socrates and Plato (and, in his earlier period, by Aristotle) and led to the
            death of ancient science by contributing to a denigration of observation, testing of
            hypotheses, and experiment. It is one of the great ironies of history that thinkers like
            Pythagoras and Plato helped to kill ancient science by propagating the belief that
            observation was not necessary since reality was rational, and therefore its nature could
            be found by the use of reason and logic alone, long after a pupil of Pythagoras,
            Hippasus of Metapontium, had used the Pythagorean theorem to demonstrate that space (and
            thus reality) is irrational.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The demonstration of the irrationality of space arose from the proof
            that the diagonal
            of a square is incommensurable with its side. We would say that, if the side of a square
            is one unit long, its diagonal, by the Pythagorean theorem, is √2 units long. And the
            square root of 2, we say, is an irrational number. But few of us really know what we
            mean by the word \"irrational\" in this sense. There are three ways of looking at it,
            each
            a slightly different way of looking at a quite irrational situation. We sometimes say
            that √2 is an endless decimal which begins with 1.41421 . . . and continues forever in
            an infinite series of digits which never ends and never repeats itself. Or we could say
            that √2 is a number which cannot be expressed as a fraction—that is, as a ratio between
            two rational numbers. But both of these statements are simply alternative ways of
            talking about the utterly irrational fact that there is no common unit of distance, no
            matter how small we make it, which will go into the side of a square a certain number of
            times and will also go into the diagonal of the square a round number of times without
            anything left over. Rationally we would think that if we took as a unit of measurement a
            distance which was infinitely small—like one-sextillionth of a cat\'s whisker or even
            one-sextillionth of that or however small a unit was needed—that we could eventually
            find a unit so small that it would go evenly into both the side and the diagonal. But
            the fact is that there is no unit, however small, which will go evenly into both
            distances, so that there is no common unit between them, and we must say that they are
            incommensurable. But this is not a situation that is rationally comprehensible to our
            conscious reasoning powers, and it is quite non logical. But it is true.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This quality of irrationality of space is not something exceptional,
            either in space
            or in other aspects of reality. The radius of a circle is similarly incommensurable with
            its circumference; the irrational relationship between the two distances is signified by
            the ratio we call π. This quality of irrationality rests on the fact that space is
            infinitely divisible; no matter how close together we make two points, the number of
            points between them remains infinite. The infinite colors of the rainbow, like the
            incommensurability of a square and its diagonal or of a circle and its radius, are
            simply applications of this irrational quality of space.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A similar irrational quality is to be found in time. We usually think
            of time as a
            succession of intervals. It is really a continuous flow, and any intervals we may choose
            to put into it, be they seconds, hours, or centuries, are arbitrary and imaginary. And
            in consequence, any conclusions we derive or any inferences we may draw from such
            intervals may be mistaken. We have twenty-four hours in the day as a purely conventional
            arrangement going back to our early ancestors in the Neolithic Garden cultures who had a
            number system based on twelve and passed on to us, as relics of that system, such
            arrangements as twelve eggs in a dozen, twelve inches in a foot, twelve pennies in a
            shilling, twenty-four parts in a carat, twelve ounces in a pound of gold, twelve deities
            on Mount Olympus, and many other odd facts of which one of the most pervasive today is
            that teenage begins with thirteen. From the Neolithic belief that day or night should
            each have twelve parts we derived our twenty-four-hour day, but since these divisions
            are arbitrary and imaginary, we could with equal justification have a day of ten hours
            or of twenty-three or twenty-five hours.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Most of us are familiar with the paradoxes of Zeno, especially with
            the one about a
            race between Achilles and a tortoise. Zeno argued that if the tortoise got a head start,
            Achilles could never catch up with him even if he could run much faster. Zeno felt that
            if the tortoise was a certain distance ahead when Achilles started, the tortoise would
            move forward a little farther while Achilles was covering the handicap distance and
            would, thus, still be ahead when Achilles finished the handicap distance. Accordingly,
            Achilles must keep on running to overcome the new increment, but by the time he had made
            up that increment the tortoise would have moved forward a new amount and would still be
            slightly ahead. According to Zeno, this process would continue forever, the tortoise
            advancing a decreasingly small amount while Achilles was making up the tortoise\'s
            previous increment. A mathematician might say that the distance between the two would
            approach zero as a limit but would reach that limit only after an infinite number of
            intervals (either of time or of distance) and that Achilles would, accordingly, not
            catch up in any finite number of intervals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The explanation of this paradox of Zeno\'s rests on the fact that the
            space and time
            through which the contestants are running are both continua, but Zeno, by treating them
            as if they were a succession of intervals, introduced an untrue condition, and from this
            contrary-to-fact assumption (that lime or space exists as a sequence of intervals) he
            derived a contrary-to-fact conclusion (that Achilles can never catch up).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Such paradoxes are good examples of the methodological rule that logic
            and rationality
            do not apply to continua. As we shall show later, this is one of the basic rules of
            historical method (although, it must be confessed, few historians give it much thought).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Space and time are not the only continua. Another familiar example is
            the system of
            real numbers. Since this is a continuum, we can state a rule: no two numbers can be
            placed so close together that there is not an infinite number of numbers between them.
            For example, between 3 and 4 are an infinite number of numbers. One of these is π. As we
            have said, π is irrational, and, accordingly, although it is a very exact number we
            cannot write it with the ordinary ten symbols used in writing numbers. If we say that π
            is 3.14, we do not refer to a single number but are really saying that π is one of the
            infinite number of numbers in the gamut from 3.135 to 3.145. In that gamut we could
            indicate that π was in a much narrower gamut (which still contains an infinite number of
            numbers) by writing its value as 3.141592. This refers to the infinite number of numbers
            in the gamut of numbers ranging from 3.1415915 to 3.1415925. Since the value of π is
            known to over a thousand decimal places, we can define the gamut of numbers within which
            π lies more and more narrowly simply by carrying the numerical expression for π to more
            decimal places. But each gamut, no matter how narrow it gets, refers to an infinite
            number of numbers, because the system of real numbers is a continuum.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;To those who are not familiar with mathematics, all of this discussion
            of √2 and π of
            may seem very strange, unreal, and unapplicable to anything with which they are
            concerned. I hope to show that the remarks I have just made about numbers are applicable
            not only to statements we all make about many familiar things but also to history.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A moment\'s thought will show that any statement about any continuum
            is just the same
            kind of statement as that which we have just made about π. Just as any value we may give
            to π refers to a gamut containing an infinite number of numbers and this gamut can be
            made narrower by carrying our statement of the value of π to more decimal places, so any
            statement about any color refers to a gamut that contains an infinite number of colors.
            Thus the word \"orange\" does not refer to a single color (any more than 3.14 refers to
            a
            single number), but rather refers to the gamut of colors between red and yellow. If we
            narrow this gamut by speaking of \"yellow-orange,\" we still are referring to an
            infinite
            number of colors. And we could make the gamut narrower by referring to \"orange
            yellow-orange\" or to \"yellow yellow-orange,\" thus bisecting the previous gamut. This
            process could be continued indefinitely, just as the value of π can be carried to more
            decimal places. The value, however, of carrying either very far is not large.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have been talking about rainbows, numbers, and space-time in order
            to establish
            what we mean by a continuum. Now we can define the term in the sense that we shall use
            it in discussing history. \"A continuum is a heterogeneous unity each point of which
            differs from all the surrounding points but differs from them by such subtle gradations
            in any one respect that no boundaries exist in the unity itself, and it can be divided
            into parts only by imaginary and arbitrary boundaries.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might add that some continua are perfect while others are highly
            imperfect, the
            distinction being that a perfect continuum has an infinite number of gradations between
            any two boundaries drawn in it, no matter how closely together they are drawn, while an
            imperfect continuum has a finite number of gradations between at least some of the
            boundaries drawn in the continuum. For example, the gamut of variations of light
            intensity during any twenty-four-hour period is a perfect continuum. But the \"races\"
            of
            mankind, however defined, are an imperfect continuum. For the variations in any standard
            we set as a criterion for race can be no more numerous than the number of individual
            human persons on the earth (that is, no more than a few billion variations) instead of
            the infinite number we expect to find in a perfect continuum. If, for example, we set
            color of skin as the criterion of \"race,\" and we were to arrange the human beings on
            the
            globe in some magical fashion in a long line with the blackest black man at one end and,
            next to him, the second blackest man, and so on, in ascending order of light reflection
            from their skin surfaces, until we passed through all the blacks, browns, reds, yellows,
            and whites to end up with the whitest white man on the globe, possibly an albino
            Norwegian—if we were to do this, I feel confident there would be no place on that long
            line where any two adjacent persons would have any difference in skin color sufficient
            to be distinguished by any normal physical process. We might then decide that men, based
            on skin color, form a single race. Or, if we insist on having more than one race, we
            might simply divide the line at its midpoint and settle for two races—the \"lights\" and
            the \"darks.\" But however many races we decided upon, there would be no discernible
            difference in skin color between any two adjacent persons between whom we drew a
            boundary line. Nevertheless, in the final analysis, this range of skin color would
            represent an imperfect continuum, because the variation of skin color between any two
            boundary lines or in the range of mankind as a whole would be numerable and not
            infinite.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We might, on the other hand, arrange mankind in a line on the basis of
            height. In that
            case we would have several billion variations over a total height difference of no more
            than seven or eight feet, giving an average difference between any two adjacent persons
            of no more than one fifty-millionth of an inch, a difference which is, once again, too
            slight to be discernible by any normal procedures and is, indeed, considerably less than
            the normal increase and decrease of any one person\'s height caused by rest and exercise
            during a day. Indeed, if we tried to arrange the persons of the world in order by height
            we would find the daily changes in individual height to be relatively so much greater
            than the average height differences between individuals that persons would be compelled,
            from their constantly changing heights, to change their positions in the line by
            hundreds of thousands and even millions of persons at relatively short intervals. If we
            were to use such a criterion as height as a measure of race, we could do so only so long
            as people were locally segregated into groups of obviously different average heights. As
            soon as people began to move about or mix socially, the classification would break down.
            And we could never classify racially, on this basis, any isolated individual.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We deal with continua rationally either by dividing them into
            arbitrary intervals to
            which we give names, or by giving names to the two ends of the continuum and using these
            terms as if the middle ground did not exist at all. This last method is called
            \"polarizing a continuum,\" and is frequently done even when the greatest frequency of
            occurrence is in the middle range. When the telephone rings in the sorority house
            because someone wants a \"blind date,\" the sisters at once ask the vital question, \"Is
            he
            tall or short?\" They ask this question even though it is perfectly obvious that the
            majority of men are neither tall nor short but are nearer the middle range. Such
            polarization of continua is so common and so familiar that we come, frequently, to
            accept our categories as real instead of being arbitrary and imaginary, as they usually
            are. An accident report asks, \"Day or night?\" although accidents are most frequent
            when
            it is neither day nor night, but dusk. Many questionnaires polarize continua by asking
            us to check: \"White—Colored?\" \"Man—Woman?\" \"Pro—Con?\" In English law this is done
            in the
            distinctions between \"Adult—Juvenile\" or \"Sane— Insane.\" In the social sciences it
            is
            done in such contrasts as \"monopoly—competition\" in economics, \"democratic—
            authoritarian\" or \"totalitarian—liberal\" in politics. We have already done it several
            times in this book, as in the dichotomy between natural science and social science or
            between objective and subjective. The familiar polarization of man into spirit and flesh
            dominated religious ethics for centuries.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This practice of slicing continua into parts or even into dual poles
            and giving names
            to these artificial categories is necessary if we are to think about the world or to
            talk about it. But we must always remain alert to the danger of believing that our terms
            are real or refer to reality except by rough approximation. Only by making such
            divisions can we deal in a rational way with the many nonrational aspects of the world.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We could, of course, renounce any desire to deal with the world
            rationally and content
            ourselves with successful nonrational dealings with it. We can deal with the
            irrationality of space, time, quantity, number, race, color, and so forth, simply by
            action. Merely to walk, or to run like Achilles, is to deal with the irrationality of
            space and time and to discover, by action, who will win in a race. When we merely walk
            along, talking with our friends, we are, by walking, dealing successfully with space and
            time. No one could ever walk rationally. Simply stand still and make an effort to walk
            rationally. What is the first thing to do? And what should be done next? What messages
            must be given to which muscles and in what sequence? We do not know, and we could not do
            such a complicated mental operation quickly enough to walk by any rational thinking
            process.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we approach history, we are dealing with a conglomeration of
            irrational continua.
            Those who deal with history by nonrational processes are the ones who make history, the
            actors in it. But the historian must deal with history by rational processes.
            Accordingly, he must be aware of the processes and difficulties to which we have
            referred when we try to deal with continua rationally. For history deals with changes in
            society. And all changes, occurring in time, involve continua. Both society and culture
            are, even if static, concerned with continua. Indeed, a society is a continuum of
            continua in five dimensions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that a society or a civilization exists in five
            dimensions, we are
            referring to the fact that it exists in the three dimensions of space, the fourth
            dimension of time, and the fifth dimension of abstraction. All of these are easy to
            understand except the last. Let us look, for a moment, at this fifth dimension of
            abstraction. It is clear that every culture consists of concrete objects like clothes
            and weapons, of less tangible objects like emotions and feelings, and of quite abstract
            things like ideas. These form the dimension of abstraction. For example, in Western
            civilization we have such items as the following: (a) automobiles, (b) romantic love,
            (c) nationalism, (d) Beethoven\'s string quartets, and (e) the integral calculus. All of
            these are clearly products of Western civilization and could not have been produced by
            any other culture. They are of different degrees of abstractness and, accordingly, we
            can say that Western culture exists in a fifth dimension, the dimension of abstraction.
            This is the same dimension as the gamut of human needs to which we previously referred.
            However, it is wider than this gamut. It may be similarly divided into six levels, in a
            rough and approximate fashion. These divisions are arbitrary and imaginary, and even the
            order in which we list the levels is partly a matter of taste. These levels are, from
            the more abstract to the more concrete: (1) intellectual, (2) religious, (3) social, (4)
            economic, (5) political, and (6) military. Each of them could, if necessary, be
            subdivided into innumerable sublevels, as, for example, the economic into agriculture,
            commerce, and industry or into production, distribution and consumption. Such varied
            divisions and subdivisions are made possible by the fact that the reality is much more
            subtle and complex than are the categories of our thinking processes.

            make a rough
            diagram of the history of any culture by letting the vertical axis represent the
            dimension of abstraction and the horizontal axis (from left to right) represent the
            passage of time. Thus:

            shall call \"development.\" Thus we may speak, for example, of the \"intellectual
            development\" or of the \"military development\" of a culture. The process of change on
            any
            single level we shall speak of as \"historical development\" (always remembering that
            the

            can speak of six basic human needs: (1) the need for group security, (2) the need to
            organize interpersonal power relationships, (3) the need for material wealth, (4) the
            need for companionship, (5) the need for psychological certainty, and (6) the need for
            understanding. To satisfy these needs, there come into existence on each level social
            organizations seeking to achieve these. These organizations, consisting largely of
            personal relationships, we shall call \"instruments\" as long as they achieve the
            purpose
            of the level with relative effectiveness. But every such social instrument tends to
            become an \"institution.\" This means that it takes on a life and purposes of its own
            distinct from the purpose of the level; in consequence, the purpose of that level is
            achieved with decreasing effectiveness. In fact, it can be stated as a rule of history
            that \"all social instruments tend to become institutions.\" The meaning of this rule
            will
            appear as we discuss its causes.

    <array name="content_4_2">
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;An instrument is a social organization that is fulfilling effectively
            the purpose for
            which it arose. An institution is an instrument that has taken on activities and
            purposes of its own, separate from and different from the purposes for which it was
            intended. As a consequence, an institution achieves its original purposes with
            decreasing effectiveness. Every instrument consists of people organized in relationships
            to one another. As the instrument becomes an institution, these relationships become
            ends in themselves to the detriment of the ends of the whole organization. When people
            want their society to be defended, they create an organization called an army. This army
            consists of many persons with different duties. Each person takes as his purpose the
            fulfilling of his duties, but this soon leaves no one in the organization with the
            purpose of the organization as his primary purpose. The purpose of the organization—in
            this case, to defend the society—becomes no more than a secondary aim for everyone in
            the organization. Defense becomes secondary to discipline, keeping authority in
            channels, feeding and paying the troops, providing supplies or intelligence, and keeping
            visiting congressmen, or the people as a whole, happy about the army, the personal
            comforts of the soldiers, and so on. Moreover, as a second reason why every instrument
            becomes an institution, everyone in such an organization is only human and has human
            weakness and ambitions, or at least has the human proclivity to see things from an
            egocentric point of view. Thus, in every organization, persons begin to seek their own
            advancements or to act for their own advantages: seeking promotions, decorations,
            increases in pay, better or easier assignments; these begin to absorb more and more of
            the time and energies of the members of an organization. All of this reduces the time
            and energy devoted to the real goal of the organization and injures the general
            effectiveness with which an organization achieves its purposes. Finally, as a third
            reason why every instrument becomes an institution, the social conditions surrounding
            any such organization change in the course of time. When this happens the organization
            must be changed to adapt itself to the changed conditions or it will function with
            decreased effectiveness. But the members of any organization generally resist such
            change; they have become \"vested interests.\" Having spent long periods learning to do
            things in a certain way or with certain equipment, they find it difficult to persuade
            themselves that different ways of doing things with different equipment have become
            necessary; and, even if they do succeed in persuading themselves, they have considerable
            difficulty in training themselves to do things in a different way or to use different
            equipment.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Military history offers numerous examples of the institutionalization
            of instruments.
            The Roman army, which had conquered most of the known world by means of the legion, was
            unable, and probably unwilling, to transform itself into a force of heavily armed
            cavalry when this became necessary in the late fourth century of our era. As a result,
            the Roman army, and the civilization it was supposed to defend, were wiped from the
            earth by the charging horsemen of Germanic barbarians, beginning with the dreadful
            defeat at Adrianople in 378. The inability of fighting men to reorganize their ideas and
            their forces from infantry to cavalry was one of the vital factors in the replacement of
            pagan Classical civilization by Christian Western civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the centuries from A.D. 700 to 1200, cavalry in the form of the
            medieval knight
            became as established in military tactics as the Roman infantry had ever been. In 732
            the Saracens, whose relentless advance had begun in Arabia a century before, were
            defeated by the cavalry of Charles Martel at Tours, and the Christian West was saved
            from Moslem conquest. By 1099 the Western counterattack had reached in apex in the
            capture of Jerusalem. In the three century interval between these two victories,
            Germanic and Frankish cavalry, under Charlemagne, Otto the Great, and others, had saved
            Western culture from numerous pagan threats. Methods of fighting from horseback had
            become well established, almost formalized, and had begun to assume those chivalric
            embellishments that contributed so much to the institutionalization of this method of
            warfare. Noble youths, as we all know, spent years in jousting and tournaments to
            achieve the skill considered necessary for success on the field of battle.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The supremacy of the medieval knight was still unquestioned in the
            early decades of
            the fourteenth century. The defeat of French chivalry at the hands of bourgeois infantry
            before Courtrai in 1302 was dismissed by the losers as an inexplicable and unrepeatable
            accident. On the Celtic fringe of Britain, similar defeats at the hands of lower-class
            longbow men were more readily recognized for what they were, a new and successful
            tactic, and bowmen were incorporated into the English armies. By means of this
            innovation, English mercenary armies were able to inflict a series of disastrous defeats
            on French feudal forces in the century following the opening of the Hundred Years\' War
            in 1338. The inability of the French knights to analyze their defeats is one of the best
            examples we have of the reactions of an institutionalized force to weapons innovation.
            Of the numerous blinders on their eyes, the most significant perhaps was their inability
            to conceive that men of low birth could kill men of noble blood from a distance. A
            similar inability, in the same period, made it impossible for the noble cavalry of
            Burgundy and of the Hapsburgs to analyze their defeats at the hands of Swiss pikemen.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The advent of gunpowder and the intensification of firepower made
            cavalry obsolescent
            in the early nineteenth century and obsolete before the end of that century, yet by 1900
            cavalrymen were still dominant in many armies and enormous resources were devoted to an
            army that was, by that time, largely worthless. As early as the Crimean War (1854-56)
            the poet Tennyson saw that it was a blunder to send cavalry charging against gunfire.
            The American Civil War should have shown clearly the demise of offensive cavalry and
            even the fraudulent nature of its claim that it was, at least, \"the eyes of the army.\"
            Yet the post-war reminiscences of officers were filled with the exploits, largely based
            on institutionalized self-deception, of military men. Reviewing some of these
            reminiscences, in its issue of October 31, 1868, the Army and Navy Journal said: \"The
            day of the saber is over. The late civil war in America, which taught so much both in
            military and naval science, made it manifest that cavalry as cavalry had finished its
            work. Already fifty years before, at Waterloo, the havoc made in the matchless \'Old
            Guard,\' the consummation and ideal of cavalry, by the English infantry, had destroyed
            the prestige of heavy cavalry on the actual battlefield. But since then, the perfection
            of rifled arms, both in infantry and artillery weapons, has made its downfall absolute.
            It is a question of shock against shock; and, with \'modern arms of precision,\' a
            compact
            body of infantry can empty every saddle in a charging squadron before it arrives to
            where sabers can be used.\" Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that firepower, as
            these words were written, had also condemned any \"compact body of infantry,\" we must
            emphasize the fact that these remarks on the role of cavalry went largely unheeded in
            military circles. By the end of the century cavalrymen, in all armies except the French
            and the Germans, were organizing, both formally and informally, to maintain the role of
            cavalry in military forces and to secure promotions for fellow cavalrymen.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The talent \"experts\" have for seeing what they expect to see or what
            they are trained
            to see rather than what is there to see is nowhere better shown than in the tactical
            discussions preceding World War I. In giving evidence before the Royal Commission on the
            [Boer] War in South Africa, that intrepid cavalryman Douglas Haig announced firmly,
            \"Cavalry will have a larger sphere of action in future wars.\" That was in 1904.
            Fourteen
            years later, as British commander in chief in France (having succeeded in that post
            another cavalryman, Sir John French), Haig had to cooperate with the commander in chief
            of the American Expeditionary Force, also a cavalry general, John Pershing. Pershing\'s
            obsession with the importance of cavalry made it necessary for him to carry on two wars,
            one against the Germans and another, almost equally virulent, against Peyton C. March,
            Chief of Staff in Washington. Much of this struggle, in which Pershing, as a public
            hero, was generally successful, was concerned with the control of transatlantic shipping
            space, which Pershing wanted to utilize for horses and fodder, while March sought to
            reserve it for men and ammunition.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In an analysis of this problem in 1935, the military historian Liddell
            Hart wrote:
            \"French, Germans, Russians, and Austrians had unexampled masses of cavalry ready at the
            outbreak of war. But in the opening phase they caused more trouble to their own sides
            than to the enemy. From 1915 on, their effect was trivial, except as a strain on their
            own country\'s supplies: despite the relatively small number of British cavalry, forage
            was the largest item of supplies sent overseas, exceeding even ammunition, and thus the
            most dangerous factor in aggravating the submarine menace; while by authoritative
            verdict, the transport trouble caused in feeding the immense number of cavalry horses
            was an important factor in producing the Russian collapse.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Nor does the story of cavalry complete the picture of how military
            institutions
            distort men\'s picture of reality to the injury of their stated aims. A more significant
            and more frightful example is to be seen in the bayonet. This steely blade was made
            obsolete by increased firepower almost as rapidly as the cavalry\'s saber, yet the
            change
            went equally unobserved by most experts. In fact, the cause of the obsolescence of both
            saber and bayonet, the great increase in firepower, especially from machine guns, went
            equally unobserved. According to the book, as taught in military schools and training
            manuals, victory in battle was achieved by methods perfected by Napoleon, as analyzed by
            Clausewitz (1780-1831). On this basis orthodox expertise established that victory was to
            be achieved by the three successive stages of artillery barrage, bayonet assault with
            infantry, and cavalry pursuit with saber. To this, near the end of the nineteenth
            century, the Frenchman Charles Ardant du Picq added the murderous addendum that all
            three of these stages were really secondary to morale. General Ferdinand Foch, for many
            years in charge of advanced training of French officers, entrenched these professional
            and erroneous views by reporting, from his on-the-field studies of the Russian- Japanese
            War of 1904-05, that machine-gun fire would not reduce the effectiveness of bayonet
            charges.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A third example of institutionalized thinking in military tactics in
            this period might
            be called the doctrine of the \"straight front.\" According to the book, the worst error
            a
            commander could make would be to allow his unit to be cut off from his line of supplies
            and to be caught in a \"crossfire.\" To avoid these errors, it was \"imperative\" to
            advance
            with a straight front against the enemy, even if this required holding back the advance
            at defensively weak spots and throwing reserves at the enemy\'s strong points. Simply by
            reversing this rule in March 1918 (by advancing as rapidly as possible and by throwing
            reserves at the defensive weak points, thus bypassing and isolating his strong points),
            Erich von Ludendorff made the most spectacular advances of the war, bursting over Chemin
            des Dames and being stopped finally, ten weeks later, thirty-four miles from Paris
            —stopped because he could not bring himself to use his unorthodox methods with full
            conviction and resources.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a consequence of the institutionalization of military tactics by
            devotion to the
            bayonet, the saber, and the straight front, the early years of World War I saw the
            largest casualties in history, suffered, in most cases, to advance over a few miles of
            devastated terrain. In the early months of 1916 almost a million casualties were
            suffered by both sides in a single battle (Verdun), while later in the same year another
            battle (Somme) cost 1,200,000 casualties, mostly by bayonet charges against machine-gun
            fire. When civilians in England tried to force the professional soldiers to use the
            tank, or civilians in Germany tried to make the professionals use poison gas against
            machine guns, both were resisted bitterly. When the civilians succeeded in ordering the
            military to use these innovations, their use was sabotaged by the soldiers. The refusal
            of the British Command, in 1915, to yield to civilian requests to shift their munition
            orders from ineffective shrapnel to high-explosive shells for barrages against trench
            defenses led to an acute intragovernmental crisis that gave impetus to the rise of David
            Lloyd George. In the American army of 1918 a major part of training time was devoted to
            bayonet practice. As late as 1940 this was still true, although in the interval the
            casualty statistics of World War I had shown that the casualty figures from bayonet
            wounds were microscopic. Non-commissioned officers, skilled in bayonet tactics, were
            reluctant to abandon something that they knew and could teach, and justified their
            inertia, in spite of the statistics, on the grounds of the presumed morale-raising
            attributes of cold steel. From experiences such as these, the French premier, Georges
            Clemenceau, drew the conclusion that \"war is far too important to ever be entrusted to
            soldiers.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Clemenceau might well have broadened his remark to say that everything
            is too
            important ever to be entrusted to professional experts, because every organization of
            such professionals and every established social organization becomes a vested-interest
            institution more concerned with its efforts to maintain itself or advance its own
            interests than to achieve the purpose that society expects it to achieve. As a
            consequence, old established armies and navies have frequently been defeated by new
            forces that have not yet become institutionalized. Thus the Greeks defeated the
            Persians; the new Roman navy defeated the Carthaginian fleet; the English defeated the
            French chivalry in the Hundred Years\' War; the English navy, barely seventy-five years
            old, defeated the Spanish Armada; Braddock was defeated; the Colonists won the American
            Revolution; the new French armies of Napoleon defeated the old, bedecorated forces of
            Austria and Prussia; the new Prussian army of Emil von Roon and Helmuth von Moltke
            defeated Austria and France in 1866 and 1870; the Boers held off the English for years;
            and Japan defeated Russia in 1905. Such defeats can be avoided only by constant reform
            that seeks to reorganize an institutionalized force so that its aim—to defeat the enemy
            —remains always paramount.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This situation appears in every social organization. Workers join
            together to get
            better pay and working conditions. The organizations they form, labor unions, soon take
            on a life of their own, and the workers begin to wonder if they are not now as much the
            slaves of the union as formerly they were slaves of the management. The kings of
            England, long ago, created a representative assembly to consent to taxation. Soon that
            assembly (Parliament) took on life of its own and ended by decapitating, removing, and
            ruling kings. A political party was organized in 1854 to protect freedom in the United
            States and to prevent the extension of slavery. By 1868 it was an organized machine of
            vested interests, a functioning spoils system, whose chief aim was to perpetuate itself
            in office and whose chief method for achieving that aim was to end the freedom of the
            whites in the South. A church is organized to bring men psychological security by
            linking them with the Deity. A century later it has become a vested institution with
            wealth and power, and its chief aim is to preserve and expand these valuable
            prerogatives. A college is organized to train youth in practical and humane
            achievements; later it has become a whole tissue of vested interests in which standards
            are lowered and admission qualifications relaxed in order to secure a flow of tuitions
            that go to meet the institution\'s expenses. Within its hallowed walls, professors
            intrigue for promotions and appointments for themselves and their disciples, while a
            condition of undeclared war goes on between departments and schools to get larger
            student enrollments in their courses and thus justify bigger slices from the annual
            university budget. Even in earlier days, professors of the classics resisted efforts to
            reduce required Latin from four years to two, or to make Greek completely elective, or
            to abolish compulsory chapel, or to establish a first (elective) course in chemistry
            without any efforts at any objective analysis of the purposes of these activities or of
            their role in training youth for later life; that these changes would reduce the
            established system\'s control of the college was, in most cases, a sufficient argument
            to
            oppose change.

            A game called football was invented about 1870 to provide healthful physical exercise
            for the undergraduates on bright autumn afternoons. Seventy years later the
            undergraduates who needed exercise most were seated in the stands of a city baseball
            park on Friday night, with their flasks and their coeds, while on the grass (or mud)
            below, the undergraduates who needed exercise least pushed each other about under the
            floodlights.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The process by which football was, almost imperceptibly, transformed
            from an
            instrument for providing physical exercise to an institution acting as an obstacle to
            exercise for many students who loved the game and needed the exercise is as instructive
            an example of social development as changes in military tactics. The informal games of
            the 1860s and early 1870s between groups from the same campus led, little by little, to
            challenges for games with other institutions. This led to travel expenses, more
            formalized rules, nonpartisan officials, and uniforms. The increase in interest led to
            larger groups of spectators. What could be more natural than to pass a hat among these
            spectators to raise money for the players\' expenses? Defeats led to desire for revenge,
            and thus to stricter rules of team membership, practice, and training. All of this led
            gradually to more formalized coaching. This task rested at first with the captain and
            more experienced players, but, as established intercollegiate rivalries began to grow,
            an experienced player of previous years, usually the last victorious captain, was asked
            to return from the outside world to coach intensively during the week before the \"big
            game.\" As other colleges adopted this pattern and several \"big games\" a year emerged,
            the demands on graduates to return to the campus for coaching duty became more than
            could be fulfilled. The obvious solution, a full-time paid coach, made it essential to
            have an established team income. \"Passing the hat\" among the spectators was replaced
            by
            sales of tickets at a fixed price. But sold tickets entitled spectators to a seat, which
            led very quickly to the building of the first modern stadium (1903). In time stadiums
            were being built with borrowed funds, with the result that their mortgage charges, along
            with coaches\' salaries and other expenses, made it essential that the stadium\'s seats,
            no matter how numerous, must be filled, or nearly filled, on the eight or so Saturdays a
            year it was used.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Gradually the interests of the spectators and the need for football
            income became
            dominant over the interests of any undergraduate who liked football or needed exercise.
            The team had to win, at least most of the time, and the game had to be spectacular to
            watch. Scouts looked for able players outside and, in one way or another, persuaded them
            to come to the scout\'s college to play football. Financial rewards proved, in many
            cases, to be powerful persuaders. Thus the game shifted from undergraduates who needed
            exercise to those who had already had too much exercise. At some institutions, where
            football incomes were earmarked for educational uses such as for building funds, almost
            all games were played in baseball parks of large cities remote from the campus, with the
            result that the team could rarely be seen by its own students. Teams that played on the
            East Coast, the West Coast, and the Gulf Coast on successive weekends spent much of the
            autumn traveling and might be away from their college halls for weeks.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When the depression cut attendance in the early 1930s, many games were
            scheduled in
            the evening to attract working spectators. For the same purpose the rules were
            manipulated to give more open play, high scores, and superiority to the offense. By
            reducing the diameter of the ball, it was made easier to pass and harder to kick, in the
            belief that spectators preferred passing. Restrictions on passing requiring a minimum
            distance behind the scrimmage line for the passer or penalizing successive incompleted
            passes were removed. To keep the ball moving on offense, the referee was instructed to
            move the ball in fifteen yards from the side lines when it became dead closer than that
            distance from the sides. At no point in this process did many persons stop to ask
            themselves, \"What is the purpose of football anyway?\" But those who look at
            football\'s
            ninety years of development can see quite clearly how an organization which originally
            rose as an instrument for undergraduate exercise had become something quite different,
            to the jeopardy of undergraduate exercise.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process, which we call the institutionalization of instruments,
            is found in
            almost all social phenomena. The purpose of music, I suppose, is to provide pleasure
            from sounds. Various notes are combined together for this purpose and are thus a medium
            for achieving the purpose of music. But if the same combinations are much used and long
            continued, they cease to provide pleasure and even cease to be heard. They become
            \"banal.\" New combinations of sound are devised, usually over the objections of the
            academician defenders of the older banal combinations who call the innovations
            \"dissonance\" or even \"discord.\" But soon the new combinations become accepted, give
            pleasure, and after much use become banal. They have become institutionalized. Later
            students, looking back over the development of music, frequently wonder what all the
            excitement was about. It is difficult for us today to hear the \"dissonance\" that
            contemporaries heard in Mozart; we even have some trouble hearing the \"discords\" with
            which Stravinsky so shocked the musical world in 1913.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A similar process can be seen in painting, sculpture, architecture,
            drama, opera,
            poetry and, indeed, in most human activities. Works that caused riots at their debuts,
            like Hugo\'s Hernani or Eliot\'s Prufrock, leave us cold or only slightly moved. They
            have
            reached a condition equivalent to music\'s banality. Expressions that were vivid,
            concrete, evocative, and thus \"poetical\" when first used become \"prosaic.\" The
            expression \"Let us get under weigh,\" which once would recall a full-sail vessel
            getting
            under the weight of its anchor and thus off to sea, has now become so lacking in these
            poetic qualities that editors, proofreaders, and even H. W. Fowler insist on spelling
            \"weigh\" as \"way.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There is of course nothing particularly original in the statement that
            organizations
            begin with devotion to a purpose and somehow along the way get turned from that purpose
            and gradually become a collection of special interests. The historians of religion
            frequently point out this process by distinguishing between \"religion\" and
            \"clericalism.\" To escape this transformation, the Quakers renounced all organizational
            features, but it can hardly be said that they have been successful in escaping
            completely from what seems to be an inevitable process of change. Thorstein Veblen
            devoted much of his analysis of our economic system to a similar process which he
            contrasted by such dichotomies as industry versus business, workmanship versus vested
            interests, or the engineers versus the price system.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The process of which we speak was generalized by Charles Peguy in
            Notre Jeunesse when
            he said, \"Everything begins as mystique and ends up as politique.\'\'\'\' In his own
            experience he had seen the idealism and broad humanitarianism of the original
            Dreyfusards gradually transformed into the selfish grasping at political power of the
            Combes ministry. The experience seared his idealistic soul to the point where he
            welcomed death from German guns in 1914. Fortunately for the survival of mankind most of
            us are not so sensitive as Peguy, for the institutionalization of social instruments is
            the most widespread of historical phenomena, and no observant person can fail to notice
            it. We shall point out many examples of this process in the rest of this volume.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When instruments become institutions, as they all do, the organization
            achieves its
            function or purpose in society with decreasing effectiveness, and discontent with its
            performance begins to rise, especially among outsiders. These discontented suggest
            changes, which they call reforms, just as we see happening in American elementary and
            secondary education today. When these suggestions are not accepted or are rejected by
            the established groups who control the criticized organization, conflicts and
            controversies begin, the discontented seeking to change the organization, while the
            vested interests seek to maintain their accustomed methods of operation. While all good
            or all wrong is never entirely on one side in such controversies, discontent and
            controversy are unlikely to rise to any important level unless the organization is well
            institutionalized and considerably less effective than the society as a whole expects.
            Accordingly, when this degree of discontent is reached, the vested-interest groups are
            generally tending to defend a relatively ineffective system and the \"reformers\" are,
            among many mistakes, generally advocating measures that would increase the
            organization\'s relative effectiveness in achieving its social purpose.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The strain between the two groups engaged in a struggle such as this
            will be called,
            in this book, \"the tension of development.\" From this tension and its ensuing
            controversy, there may emerge any one (or combination) among three possible outcomes:
            reform, circumvention, or reaction. In the first case, reform, the institution is
            reorganized and its methods of action changed so that it becomes, relatively speaking,
            more of an instrument and achieves its purpose with sufficient facility to reduce
            tension to a socially acceptable level. In the second case, circumvention, the
            institution is left with most of its privileges and vested interests intact, but its
            duties are taken away and assigned to a new instrument within the same society. This
            second method is much used by the English. The king was left covered with honors, but
            the task of governing England was taken over by Parliament and ultimately by a committee
            of Parliament. The Lord Warden of the Cinq Ports has a brilliant uniform and a drafty
            castle, but the task of guarding the seas of England was given to the Royal Navy in the
            sixteenth century. The Earl Marshal of England is left with titles and social prestige
            and still manages the coronation, but the job of leading the army was given to a
            commander in chief. In the period before the tenth century, when Europe needed defense,
            an organization called feudalism grew up to provide this need, and performed its task so
            well that European culture was preserved from the assaults of the Saracens, the pagan
            Germans, and the eastern raiders. In fact, feudalism performed its task so well that by
            1100 Europe was mounting that counterassault that we call the Crusades. But within three
            hundred years, feudalism had become a vested institution of hereditary privileges and
            emoluments. It was circumvented by creating in the society a new organization, called
            the Royal Army, to which the task of defense was given. The privileged vested interests
            of feudalism were neither reformed nor abolished but were left as a structure of honor
            and rewards that we call chivalry and the hereditary nobility.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the third possible outcome, reaction, the vested interests triumph
            in the struggle,
            and the people of that society are doomed to ineffective achievement of their needs on
            that level for an indefinite period. The agrarian system of ancient Rome was an
            inefficient method of producing food even in respect of the existing technical
            knowledge, but to reform it would have involved abolition of slavery and division of the
            large estates. The reformers who wanted to do this were assassinated by the daggers of
            the landlords, some on the floor of the senate itself. As a result, the economic needs
            of the Roman system could be met only by the use of other levels, especially by military
            conquest and by political exploitation of conquered provinces. But in time, both the
            political and the military organizations became ineffective vested institutions. The
            result was civil war and eventual conquest by outside barbarians.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When an institution has been reformed or circumvented, there is once
            again an
            instrument on the level in question, and the purpose of that level is achieved with
            relative effectiveness. But, once again, as always happens, the new instrument becomes
            an institution, effectiveness decreases, tension of development rises, and conflict
            appears. If the outcome of this conflict is either reform or circumvention,
            effectiveness increases and tension decreases. If the outcome is reaction,
            ineffectiveness becomes chronic and tension remains high.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a result of this process of historical development, the development
            of each level
            appears in history as a pulsating movement. Periods of economic prosperity alternate
            with periods of economic stagnation; periods of religious or intellectual satisfaction
            alternate with periods of religious or intellectual frustration. Periods of political
            order or military success alternate with periods of political disorder or military
            disaster.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process of historical development takes place on innumerable
            levels of a society
            because there are innumerable levels to the culture. But this process is only one aspect
            of the historical evolution of a society. The other aspect we call historical
            morphology; it is concerned with the relationships between the different levels of
            culture in a society. Before we examine it, we might state, in a formal way, three
            definitions:
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;1. Historical development is concerned with the changes that take
            place on any single
            level of culture in a society.\n
            2. Historical morphology is concerned with the ways in which one level of culture
            influences the other levels of culture in the same society.\n
            3. Historical evolution is a resultant of historical development and historical
            morphology, both acting simultaneously and reacting on each other.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;\"Morphology\" is a word borrowed from biology. It means that the
            parts of a living
            organism are adapted to one another. In its most obvious sense it means that a giraffe
            could not possibly have the neck of an elephant nor could an elephant have the legs of a
            giraffe. But it also has a more subtle meaning. When we speak of a heavyweight boxer we
            frequently mention his \"best fighting weight.\" This means that, given his height,
            reach,
            age, experience, and all the rest of his specifications, there is an optimum weight for
            his best fighting ability. If he is over that weight, he is slowed up; if he is under
            that weight, his blows lack impact. On the other hand, if he is at his best fighting
            weight, there is also an optimum length for his arms or an optimum height. If his reach
            or his height varies by much from these optimum points, his fighting ability will
            suffer. All of these are morphological relationships.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The same kinds of morphological relationships appear in a society. The
            ability of a
            society to defend itself on the military level is dependent on its ability to provide
            domestic order on the political level, wealth on the economic level, companionship on
            the social level, understanding on the intellectual level, and psychic certainty on the
            religious level. At the same time the ability of the society to defend itself affects
            its ability to achieve these five other goals. Thus each level is closely connected with
            all the others. It would be quite impossible to support a mechanized army without a
            fairly centralized political system, without a highly industrialized economic system, or
            without a fairly active scientific tradition on the intellectual level. On the other
            hand, a military system like feudalism, in which men fought as trained specialists on
            horseback, could be supported by a completely decentralized political system (in which
            there was no state at all) or by a purely agricultural economic system, and with an
            intellectual system which emphasized honor and loyalty rather than knowledge or science.
            Such a system existed in Western Europe about the year 1100, just as the system
            indicated in the preceding sentence exists in Europe in the twentieth century.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Just as there is an optimum length for a giraffe\'s neck (given all
            his other
            measurements as fixed), and just as there is a best fighting weight or a best length of
            reach for a heavyweight boxer (given all his other measurements as fixed), so also there
            is an optimum point of development on each level of culture (assuming all the other
            levels have reached fixed points of development). This optimum point for each level in
            relationship to the development of each other level is the point at which morphological
            tension is least. This means that time and energy on each level can be devoted to
            achieving the purpose of each level and need not be used up in interlevel friction
            because of the need to speed up the development of another level; nor need such energy
            and time be used in any one level in amounts beyond that which would be required to
            attain a certain degree of achievement on that level because of the inadequacies of some
            other level. For example, if the point of development of the political level is
            morphologically inadequate, more time and energy must be expended on the economic or the
            military level to achieve a certain amount of production or protection from these
            levels. All this is really nothing more than a rewording of our previous statement that
            culture is integrative. And just as we said, at that time, that culture never gets
            integrated and that it would be a bad thing if it did, so we can say here that
            morphological tension never reaches zero and that it would be a bad thing if it did (for
            then the society would be rigidly frozen into an unchanging pattern and would perish).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We can picture this somewhat more clearly with the aid of a diagram.
            In this diagram
            we shall mark, very roughly, the point which we believe our Western society has reached
            on each of the six levels of culture:

        <item>Imageimage_4_4_63</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Each of these points is a very rough estimate because each represents
            the resultant of
            a large number of sublevels. For example, the point we have indicated on the
            Intellectual Level represents the resultants of a very advanced science, a very backward
            art, a fairly mediocre humanities, and other factors. The backwardness of our religious
            development or of our social developments represents the widespread frustration of these
            human needs, the low level of our appreciation of the nature of deity, the widespread
            failure to establish any feeling of relationship between this deity and man\'s spiritual
            life and, on the social level, the widespread frustration of men\'s gregarious needs in
            a
            society built on great cities, millions of unrecognized faces in those cities, and a
            general lack of established, satisfying social relationships.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The advanced point indicated on the economic and military levels
            indicates the
            extraordinary success we have had in producing wealth and in directing power against
            outside societies. Our amazingly high standards of living are proof of the advanced
            status of the economic level, while the numbers of outside societies that we have
            destroyed (from the American Indians and the Australian aborigines to Mandarin China or
            Mogul India) are witness to our success on the military level. The advanced states of
            both of these levels are largely due to the even further advanced state of our
            intellectual level. The fact that the latter is still in advance of the economic or
            military level means that its morphological influence on them is still tending to pull
            them forward. On the other hand, the backwardness of these two levels (and, indeed, of
            the three others as well) in relationship to the intellectual level is tending to hold
            the development of this last level back. Thus each level acts upon all the others.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The backwardness of our religious and social developments is
            undoubtedly holding back
            the development of the intellectual and political levels. At the same time, the
            relatively advanced state of the intellectual, economic, and military developments of
            our society is forcing the political development forward, while the backwardness of the
            political level has a tendency to hold the developments on the military, economic, and
            intellectual levels back. The backwardness of one level of development in respect of
            other levels of development is widely recognized among students of society, and is
            called \"cultural lag.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the specific case we have just mentioned (the cultural lag of the
            political level),
            we are also dealing with a widely recognized fact. Our political organization, based as
            it is on an eighteenth-century separation of powers and on a nineteenth- century
            nationalist state, is generally recognized to be semi obsolete. We hear demands for a
            \"European federation\" or for a \"twentieth-century Congress.\" The breakdown of the
            separation of powers is evident in the rapid growth of administrative regulation (which
            disregards such separation). The need to adapt the United States Constitution to the
            speed of communication of the twentieth century is evident in the Twentieth Amendment,
            which moved the inauguration date up from March 4 to January 20. The need for further
            adaptation is clear from the fact that the American Congress still spends hours of its
            inadequate time on verbal roll-call votes when it could make a permanent record vote by
            electricity in a few seconds. The power of vested institutionalism is evident in
            congressional resistance to a reform that would force congressmen to make a public
            record of their positions on each bill.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;One last example of morphological interrelationships, and that the
            most extreme, could
            be found in the relationship of the atomic bomb to Western civilization. This bomb was a
            product of our advanced development on the intellectual, economic, and military levels.
            The fact that this great discovery of atomic fission was used for a purely destructive
            purpose is due to the backwardness of our religious, social, and political levels. But
            the advanced condition of certain levels, as signified by the bomb, has undoubtedly had
            profound influences on the three more backward levels and will force them to advance
            more rapidly. There can be little doubt that the advent of atomic warfare on the
            military level has had profound effects and will have even more profound effects on the
            three backward levels. People are, in consequence of its use, turning again to the
            problem of religion or the inadequacy of our political development. The decentralization
            of our cities is a process already clearly evident from such forces as improved
            communications (telephone) and transportation (automobiles), and is reflected in the
            growth of suburbs and the decrease in metropolitan growth; if the atom bomb speeds up
            this process, it will probably lead to a considerable advance on the social level. As
            people disperse from the great beehives of modern cities to the more intimate living of
            the suburbs and countryside, there will undoubtedly be a considerable improvement in the
            satisfaction of men\'s needs for companionship on this social level.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Even in our oversimplified diagram of six levels, it is clear that the
            process of
            morphology is a complex one. There are thirty-six interrelationships between the six
            levels we have, and, since each relationship works both ways, there are seventy-two
            factors at work. But when we remember that the divisions between these levels are
            arbitrary and imaginary and that really there are an infinite number of levels, each
            acting upon all the others, pulling these others forward or backward and being pulled
            backward or forward in turn, it is clear that the reality of cultural morphology is
            unbelievably complex. The number of factors at work with an infinite number of levels is
            infinity raised to the infinite power and multiplied by two. This is a number large
            enough for anyone.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;What happens in a society as a whole, what we called \"historical
            evolution,\" is a
            resultant of historical development and morphology acting both independently and upon
            each other. If a level of development is going through the process of development that
            we have described—the process of institutionalization of instruments with growing
            tension —the outcome of such tension, as between reform, circumvention, and reaction,
            may well be determined by morphological factors. A level, regarded as if it were alone,
            may have all the factors necessary to produce reform. But the influence of morphology
            may produce reaction. Something like this occurred in Spain in the period 1930-40.
            There, all the factors on the political level seemed to be leading toward reform, but
            the backwardness of the five other levels and the great power of the institutionalized
            vested interests on those five other levels turned political reform into political
            reaction.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is clear that every civilization undergoes a process of historical
            change. We can
            see that a civilization comes into existence, passes through a long experience, and
            eventually goes out of existence. We know, for example, that Mesopotamian civilization
            did not exist about 10,000 B.C.; it did exist about 3000 B.C.; it had ceased to exist by
            A.D. 1000. Similarly, it is clear that Classical civilization did not exist about 1500
            B.C.; it clearly did exist about 500 B.C.; and it had obviously passed out of existence
            by A.D. 1000. And, finally, it is clear that Western civilization did not exist about
            A.D. 500; it did exist in full flower about A.D. 1500; and it will surely pass out of
            existence at some time in the future, perhaps before A.D. 2500. Now, while everyone will
            probably agree with all this, it would be difficult to obtain agreement on any specific
            dates on which these events occurred. This difficulty arises from the fact that
            civilizations come into existence, rise and flourish, and go out of existence by a slow
            process which covers decades or even centuries, and historians are unable to agree on
            any precise dates for these events. This is perfectly proper: if Classical civilization
            came into existence by a slow process and went out of existence by a slow process, it
            would give a false appearance of rigidity to fix its dates, say at 1184 B.C.-A.D. 476,
            as has sometimes been done. In the following discussion it should be remembered that the
            dates given for historical periods are only approximate.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Beyond recognizing that civilizations begin and end, historians are
            fairly well agreed
            that, after they begin, they flourish and grow for a while, that eventually they reach a
            peak of power and prosperity, and that they weaken and decay before their final end.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This process of evolution of civilizations can only be studied in an
            effective fashion
            if we divide it into a number of consecutive periods. We might divide it into two
            periods, such as \"rise\" and \"decline\"; we might divide it into three periods, such
            as
            \"youth,\" \"maturity,\" and \"old age\"; or we might divide it into five or fifty
            periods.
            The process of change in the history of any civilization is a continuum and,
            accordingly, the periods into which we may divide it are arbitrary and imaginary. Thus,
            it might be argued that one system of periodization is as good as another and,
            accordingly, we are free to divide it in any way that seems to fit our purpose at the
            moment. To some extent this is true, as long as we are aware that our periods are
            subjective, but necessary, divisions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;However, it is not completely true that one periodization is as good
            as another,
            although any system of periodization may well be useful for some specific purpose.
            Obviously, periodization must depend on changes in the society\'s culture. And, equally
            obviously, changes in a culture must depend on the causes of these changes. Accordingly,
            the periodization should, ideally, depend on the causes of the culture changes. This
            rule has been consistently neglected in all discussion of this subject. Writers tell us
            that a civilization rises and falls; they divide this process into periods, and they
            sometimes try to explain why it rises and falls; but they rarely relate their periods of
            the process of change to their explanation of the causes of the change.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The most popular explanation of the causes of historical change and
            especially of the
            rise and fall of civilizations has been by means of some biological analogy in which a
            people, once young and vigorous, were softened and weakened by rising standards of
            living, or by a loss of the ideology of hard work and self-sacrifice that had made their
            rise possible. In most cases little or no effort has been made to correlate this process
            of change with the various stages through which the civilization was said to have
            passed. In some cases this \"softening of fiber\" theory has been presented in a more
            naive form by a simple biological analogy in which civilizations, like man himself, were
            felt to pass through a simple sequence of youth, maturity, and old age. In many cases no
            real explanation of the process of change has been given at all, the theorists in
            question being satisfied with attaching names to the various stages of historical
            change. Giovanni Battista Vico, for example, saw the history of each people as a process
            by which barbarian vigor slowly developed into rationalism, the period of greatest
            success being merely the middle period when the two qualities of vigor and rationality
            were in a fruitful, precarious, and temporary balance, while the decline was due to the
            final triumph of rationalism over energy. In the late nineteenth century, as biological
            sciences became more influential, these basic ideas were reserved with varying
            quantities of biological sauces. The Russian thinker Nikolai Danilevsky attributed the
            earlier period of vigor to biologic mixture of peoples, and attributed the intermediate
            ages of greatest achievement to the rise of a state organization that could direct such
            energies into more productive channels. The final stage of decay is not clearly
            explained but seems to be attributed to some process of political institutionalization
            not too remote from the explanation offered here.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, the
            influences of Darwinian
            thinking became dominant in theories of civilization dynamics. W. M. Flinders Petrie in
            1911 offered a Darwinian version of the theories of earlier writers such as Danilevsky:
            an earlier period of struggle, based on the vigorous energy of barbarian intruders, was
            gradually weakened by the enjoyment of rising standards of living which weakened
            \"strife.\" Enunciating the general rule, \"There is no advance without strife,\" Petrie
            pictured each cycle as an accelerating decay resulting from a decrease in \"strife.\"
            This
            point of view, generally accepted by many of the earlier theorists on this subject, saw
            the later stages of any civilization as a period of decreasing strife or violence, a
            conclusion which seems to be sharply at variance with the facts.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;To Oswald Spengler, one of the most famous of modern writers on this
            subject, a
            similar pattern was evident. He discerned in each people an earlier stage of vigorous
            creativity that he called \"culture\" and a later stage of weakening moral fiber and
            devotion to selfish physical comforts that he called \"civilization.\" As is usual among
            writers on this subject, no real explanation was provided for this loss of motion,
            although the pattern was applied to ten different \"cultures.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The most famous of recent writers on this subject, Arnold J. Toynbee,
            has produced the
            most voluminous and, in spite of its sprawling organization, most satisfactory theory of
            these processes. He is still strongly influenced by Darwinian biology, and attributes
            rise and fall of civilizations to the \"challenge and response\" to \"the struggle for
            existence.\" In spite of his many improvements over earlier writers, especially in
            regard
            to the units to which this pattern applies and the stages through which the pattern
            takes each unit, Toynbee\'s theories have several of the prevalent inadequacies of
            earlier writers, especially in his failure to correlate the stages of change with the
            process of change and, above all, in his failure to explain why a civilization which has
            been \"responding\" to \"challenges\" successfully for centuries gradually ceases to do
            so,
            and decays.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Most of the earlier writers derived their patterns from the study of a
            relatively few
            units, and generally based their interpretations very largely on the Greco-Roman
            experience in Classical antiquity. This reliance on the culture that most of us know
            best is, of course, to be expected, but has been unfortunate, since the pattern of rise
            and fall in Classical antiquity is not completely typical, as can be seen from the
            difficulty most writers have had in deciding whether the Greeks and Romans should be
            treated separately or together.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Vico derived his pattern from only two examples, Roman and Christian
            cultures, but
            most later writers had information, however vague, on a much greater number of cases.
            Many had no clear idea of the unit we call \"civilization,\" and they confused peoples,
            political units, societies, and even religions in an indiscriminate fashion, greatly
            increasing the difficulty of finding patterns of change. Danilevsky spoke of ten
            historical \"types,\" to which he added Russia as an eleventh in the future. In general
            his units were linguistic groupings, so that the Greeks and Romans were treated as
            separate units. Spengler also spoke of ten, but his units were different from
            Danilevsky\'s and were made very ambiguous in some cases by being based on spiritual
            outlooks, such as his famous conceptions of Apollonian (Classical), Faustian (Western),
            and Magian (post-Classical Near Eastern) cultures. Toynbee saw about two dozen
            civilizations, not much different from those accepted in this present book.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The pattern of change in civilizations presented here consists of
            seven stages
            resulting from the fact that each civilization has an instrument of expansion that
            becomes an institution. The civilization rises while this organization is an instrument
            and declines as this organization becomes an institution.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;By the term \"instrument of expansion\" we mean that the society must
            be organized in
            such fashion that three things are true: (1) the society must be organized in such a way
            that it has an incentive to invent new ways of doing things; (2) it must be organized in
            such a way that somewhere in the society there is accumulation of surplus—that is, some
            persons in the society control more wealth than they wish to consume immediately; and
            (3) it must be organized in such a way that the surplus which is being accumulated is
            being used to pay for or to utilize the new inventions. All three of these things are
            essential to any civilization. Taken together, we call them an instrument of expansion.
            If a producing society has such an organization (an instrument of expansion), we call it
            a civilization, and it passes through the process we are about to describe. Before we
            describe this process, however, we should be certain we understand the nature of an
            instrument of expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The three essential parts of an instrument of expansion are incentive
            to invent,
            accumulation of surplus, and application of this surplus to the new inventions.
            Economists might call these three \"invention,\" \"saving,\" and \"investment,\" but the
            terms
            used by economists are generally so ambiguous to noneconomists that we hesitate to use
            them.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;\"Incentive to invent\" is sometimes difficult for students to grasp
            because they
            assume
            that all societies are equally inventive, or that \"necessity is the mother of
            invention,\" or that invention is somehow related to innate, hereditary biological
            talent
            (so that there are \"inventive races\" and \"noninventive races\"). None of these things
            is
            true. Some societies, like Mesopotamian civilization or our own Western civilization,
            are very inventive. Others, like many primitive tribes, or civilizations like the
            Egyptian, are very uninventive. Nor does \"necessity\" have much to do with
            inventiveness.
            If it did, those peoples who are pressed down upon the subsistence level, or even below
            it, in their standards of living, like some of the Indian tribes of the Matto Grosso,
            would be very inventive, which they are not. Or, if invention were in any way related to
            necessity, the poverty stricken fellahin of Egypt or Trans-Jordan or the equally
            hard-pressed coolies of China or the peasants of India would have devised some new and
            helpful methods for exploiting their available resources. This is far from being the
            case. Or, again, if biologically inherited talent had anything to do with inventiveness
            we would not have seen the great decrease in invention by the Chinese in the last
            thousand years, or the decrease in inventiveness among Anglo-Saxon Americans in the last
            hundred years, or the sudden appearance of inventiveness among noninventive peoples of
            eastern European stock when they migrated to America.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Inventiveness depends very largely on the way a society is organized.
            Some societies
            have powerful incentives to invent, because they are organized in such a way that
            innovation is encouraged and rewarded. This was true of Mesopotamian civilization before
            2700 B.C., of Chinese civilizations before A.D. 1200, and of Western civilization during
            much of its history. On the other hand, many societies are organized so that they have
            very weak incentives to invent. Suppose that a primitive tribe believes that its social
            organization was established by a deity who went away leaving strict instructions that
            nothing be changed. Such a society would invent very little. Egyptian civilization was
            something like this. Or any society that had ancestor worship would probably have weak
            incentives to invent. Or a society whose productive system was based on slavery would
            probably be uninventive, because the slaves, who knew the productive process most
            intimately, would have little incentive to devise new methods since these would be
            unlikely to benefit themselves, while the slaveowners would have only a distant
            acquaintance with the productive processes and would be reluctant to invent any new
            methods that might well require the ending of slavery for their successful exploitation.
            For these reasons, slave societies, such as Classical civilization or the Southern
            states of the United States in the period before 1860, have been notoriously
            uninventive. No major inventions in the field of production came from either of these
            cultures. The significance of this can be realized when we recall that at the very time
            that the South was inventing so little, the North, and especially the people of the
            Connecticut River Valley, were passing through one of the greatest periods of invention
            in history (cotton gin, mass production and interchangeable parts, steamboat, screw
            propeller, revolver, electric motor, vulcanizing rubber, sewing machine, anaesthesia,
            and so forth).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;\"Accumulation of surplus\" means that some persons or organizations
            in the society
            have
            more wealth passing through their control than they wish to use immediately or in the
            \"short run.\" This is so necessary to expansion that it means that some persons must
            have
            more than they need, even if others must have less than they need. If a society
            containing 100 persons is producing 100 square meals a day, it would, perhaps, be
            \"just\"
            for each person to obtain one meal a day, but such a distribution would never allow the
            society to increase its production of meals except by temporary and accidental increases
            called \"windfalls.\" If, however, the distribution of square meals in that society is
            organized so that fifty persons get only half a meal a day, twenty-five persons get one
            meal a day each, and twenty-five persons get two meals a day each, it might be possible
            for the society to increase its production of square meals. This could be done if
            someone invented a better way of producing square meals and if the twenty-five persons
            who get two meals each a day, consumed only one and a half meals each day and gave the
            surplus of twelve and a half meals each day to twenty-five of the fifty persons who had
            only half a meal each in return for their efforts in making the new, more productive,
            invention. This redistribution of meals to obtain the use of a new invention is what we
            mean by \"investment,\" the third essential element in any instrument of expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We thus have three possible ways in which the 100 meals produced by
            this society could
            be distributed. They could be written as follows:

            someone thinks of
            a new invention, since no one would have leisure to make it. With Type B distribution
            there may be an increase in output but only if someone thinks of a new invention and if
            the surplus of meals controlled by the twenty-five richest persons is redistributed to
            the poorer persons as payment for these poorer ones making the new invention. This would
            give a third type of income distribution if the surplus was invested in the way
            mentioned. Thus:

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Every kind of material progress and many kinds of nonmaterial progress
            depend upon the
            three factors we have mentioned. This is as true of parasitic societies as it is of
            productive societies. Let us imagine a solitary savage who lives by hunting and who, by
            throwing rocks at game from dawn to dusk, averages one rabbit a day. Let us further
            imagine that this diet of one rabbit a day is just enough to keep him alive until the
            next day. In such a situation this lonely hunter could not make a bow and arrow, even if
            he could invent it in his mind, because to make a bow and arrow would take, let us say,
            ten days\' work. Thus this savage has an incentive to invent, even has the necessary
            invention, but he has no surplus and cannot improve his position. Then let us assume
            that he throws a rock one day and kills a deer large enough to keep him alive for twelve
            days. He now has both invention (in his mind) and surplus (the deer). He may live from
            the deer for twelve days in idleness, or he may use his leisure from hunting to make the
            bow and arrow he has conceived. In the former case he will be no better off, and may be
            worse off because of loss of skill in rock throwing as a result of such leisure. In the
            latter case, on the contrary, his surplus (the deer) is transformed into a bow and arrow
            by investment, and at the end of ten days he has a new weapon that raises his ability to
            kill rabbits from an average of one a day to, say, an average of three a day. Of these
            three he can consume one a day himself, as previously, and support two other savages
            with the two other rabbits he kills each day. In return for such support, these two
            could be required to build a hut, to cure rabbit skins, to make additional arrows, and
            so forth. In this way the new capital equipment, the bow and arrow, has made it possible
            to raise the standards of living of all three.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is by some such process as this, but much more elaborate and
            complex, that
            civilizations grow, thrive, and expand. Every civilization must be organized in such a
            way that it has invention, capital accumulation, and investment. Loosely speaking, the
            term \"instrument of expansion\" might be applied to the organization for capital
            accumulation alone, although, strictly speaking, this organization should be called the
            surplus-creating instrument. This surplus-creating instrument is the essential element
            in any civilization, although, of course, there will be no expansion unless the two
            other elements (invention and investment) are also present. However, the
            surplus-creating instrument, by controlling the surplus and thus the disposition of it,
            will also control investment and will, thus, have at least an indirect influence on the
            incentive to invent. This surplus-creating instrument does not have to be an economic
            organization. In fact, it can be any kind of organization, military, political, social,
            religious, and so forth. In Mesopotamian civilization it was a religious organization,
            the Sumerian priesthood to which all members of the society paid tribute. In Egyptian,
            Andean and, probably, Minoan civilizations it was a political organization, a state that
            created surpluses by a process of taxation or tribute collection. In Classical
            civilization it was a kind of social organization, slavery, that allowed one class of
            society, the slaveowners, to claim most of the production of another class in society,
            the slaves. In the early part of Western civilization it was a military organization,
            feudalism, that allowed a small portion of the society, the fighting men or lords, to
            collect economic goods from the majority of society, the serfs, as a kind of payment for
            providing political protection for these serfs. In the later period of Western
            civilization the surplus-creating instrument was an economic organization (the
            price-profit system, or capitalism, if you wish) that permitted entrepreneurs who
            organized the factors of production to obtain from society in return for the goods
            produced by this organization a surplus (called profit) beyond what these factors of
            production had cost these entrepreneurs.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Like all instruments, an instrument of expansion in the course of time
            becomes an
            institution and the rate of expansion slows down. This process is the same as the
            institutionalization of any instrument, but appears specifically as a breakdown of one
            of the three necessary elements of expansion. The one that usually breaks down is the
            third— application of surplus to new ways of doing things. In modern terms we say that
            the rate of investment decreases. If this decrease is not made up by reform or
            circumvention, the two other elements (invention and accumulation of surplus) also begin
            to break down. This decrease in the rate of investment occurs for many reasons, of which
            the chief one is that the social group controlling the surplus ceases to apply it to new
            ways of doing things because they have a vested interest in the old ways of doing
            things. They have no desire to change a society in which they are the supreme group.
            Moreover, by a natural and unconscious self-indulgence, they begin to apply the surplus
            they control to non-productive but ego-satisfying purposes such as ostentatious display,
            competition for social honors or prestige, construction of elaborate residences,
            monuments, or other structures, and other expenditures which may distribute the
            surpluses to consumption but do not provide more effective methods of production.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When the instrument of expansion in a civilization becomes an
            institution, tension
            increases. In this case we call this \"tension of evolution.\" The society as a whole
            has
            become adapted to expansion; the mass of the population expect and desire it. A society
            that has an instrument of expansion expands for generations, even for centuries.
            People\'s minds become adjusted to expansion. If they are not \"better off\" each year
            than
            they were the previous year, or if they cannot give their children more than they
            themselves started with, they became disappointed, restless, and perhaps bitter. At the
            same time the society itself, after generations of expansion, is organized for expansion
            and undergoes acute stresses if expansion slows up.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The nature of these organizational stresses and tensions arising from
            a decrease in
            the rate of a society\'s expansion can be seen most clearly in contemporary Western
            civilization. In this society the economic system produces three kinds of goods: (a)
            consumers\' goods and services, (b) capital goods, which cannot be consumed but which
            can
            be used to make consumers\' goods, and (c) government goods and services, including
            armaments. In producing each kind of goods, the factors of production, such as land,
            labor, materials, capital, managerial skills, entrepreneurial enterprise, legal fees,
            distribution costs, and so forth, must be used and paid for. These costs, including
            profits for entrepreneurs, have a double aspect. On the one side they represent the
            costs of producing the goods, and thus determine the final selling price of the goods;
            this must be sufficiently high to cover these costs. But, on the other hand, these costs
            represent the incomes of those who receive them and thus represent the purchasing power
            available to buy the goods offered for sale. If we look, for a moment, only at the flow
            of consumers\' goods, we see that this flow of goods is offered for sale at a price
            that,
            by just covering the costs of the goods, is just equivalent to the purchasing power
            distributed to the economic community as incomes available for buying these goods. But,
            of course, some incomes are saved. These savings reduce the flow of purchasing power
            below the level of the flow of consumers\' goods at prices sufficient to cover costs of
            these goods. Thus there is not sufficient purchasing power available to buy the goods
            being offered at the price being asked, and either goods must go unsold or prices must
            fall, unless the money which was held back as savings appears in the market as
            purchasing power for consumers\' goods. Traditionally, this reappearance of savings as
            purchasing power in the market occurred through investment— that is, as expenditures for
            the factors of production to be used to make capital goods. This process provided the
            purchasing power needed to permit the flow of consumers\' goods to go to consumers
            because investment distributed rent, salaries, wages, interest, profits, and such to the
            community to form incomes and thus available purchasing power but did not demand
            purchasing power from the economic community because the producers\' goods created by
            these expenditures were not offered for sale to consumers, as consumers goods were, but,
            if sold at all, were merely exchanged for the savings of investors. This whole
            relationship means that our modern economic system cannot produce and consume what it
            produces unless it also invests (that is, expands).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;After centuries of expansion our society is now organized so that it
            cannot subsist;
            it must expand or it will collapse. This relationship might be expressed in the rule
            that, unless savings are invested in producers\' goods, there will not be sufficient
            purchasing power to buy the consumers\' goods that are being produced. Of course, as
            this
            problem has become increasingly acute in the contemporary period, a third factor has
            intervened: government spending. Such government spending provides purchasing power just
            as investment does. When the factors of production are mobilized at government cost to
            make a nuclear submarine, the community obtains incomes available as purchasing power,
            and no subsequent claim on this purchasing power is made by government action, since the
            submarine is not offered for sale. Of course, insofar as this government spending is
            covered by taxes levied on consumers\' purchasing power there is no net increase in such
            purchasing power; but a considerable part of government spending is covered by taxes on
            savings (and thus operates like investment) or is not covered by taxes at all (and thus
            represents a net increase in purchasing power, an inflationary increase when savings are
            being invested fully).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This rather complicated example of how an expanding society can become
            so organized
            for expansion that it enters upon an acute crisis if the expansion rate decreases is
            worth analyzing, because somewhat similar crises occur in all civilizations when the
            rate of expansion decreases. And such decrease is the chief result of the
            institutionalization of the instrument of expansion, something that occurs in every
            civilization. We shall see many examples of this and of the varied ways this process
            occurs when we make a more detailed analysis of the evolution of various civilizations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Our tentative definition of a civilization was \"a producing society
            that has writing
            and city life.\" This definition is imperfect because it is descriptive rather than
            analytical; it is also imperfect because it is not completely true. Western civilization
            about A.D. 970 had almost no city life, but still was a stage in a civilization. And
            Andean civilization, even under the Inca Empire, had no writing, but clearly was a
            civilization. It is now possible to offer a better, if not perfect, definition of a
            civilization: \"a producing society with an instrument of expansion.\"
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Before we go on to examine the consequences when an instrument of
            expansion becomes an
            institution, we might point out that the surplus-creating organization that is such an
            essential part of any instrument of expansion does not need to be the only
            surplus-creating organization in the society. In all societies there are other, less
            significant, surplus- creating organizations than the one we have considered part of the
            instrument of expansion. In Mesopotamian civilization the significant surpluses were
            accumulated by the Sumerian priesthood from tithes and its own profits, but there can be
            no doubt that private persons were accumulating surpluses from profits of private
            enterprise or from the earnings of privately owned slaves or even from voluntary
            restrictions on their own consumption. These kinds of surplus accumulation may be found
            in any civilization no matter what preponderance may exist for its \"own\" instrument of
            expansion. In 1850, when Western civilization was most completely organized on the basis
            of private profit, surplus was undoubtedly being accumulated, and invested, from
            government taxes or from private slavery. And we would not be surprised if the most
            socialistic civilizations, like the Andean under the Incas or the Russian under the
            Soviets, had a certain amount of private accumulation from profits.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These variant and incidental types of surplus accumulation are usually
            of little
            significance in a civilization, not only for their relatively small volume of savings
            but even more because they are not usually expended in productive investment but rather
            are likely to end up in luxury expenditures and are, thus, little more than postponed or
            transferred consumption. In theory, however, it must be admitted that our statement that
            \"every civilization has an instrument of expansion\" could well be understood to mean
            that a civilization has at least one such instrument. Except for one dubious case, we do
            not know of any civilization, in its prime of life, that has had more than one
            significant surplus-creating organization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have said that an instrument of expansion, like all instruments,
            becomes an
            institution and that as a result the rate of expansion begins to decline. This
            institutionalization of the organization of expansion, which usually takes the form of a
            decreasing rate of investment (rather than of a decrease in either invention or in
            accumulation of surplus), leads to a crisis. This crisis, which we have called
            increasing tension of evolution, arises from the clash between the decreasing rate of
            expansion, on one hand, and the fact that people\'s minds and the organization of the
            society are arranged for expansion, on the other hand. Reserving until later our
            detailed examination of the forms this crisis takes, we might point out here that it
            usually gives rise to conflicts between the vested-interest groups that control the
            uninvested accumulations of surplus (because they control the surplus-creating
            organization in the society) and are sufficiently satisfied with the existing social
            organization to desire no change and the great mass of the population who are
            discontented at the dwindling prospects of expansion.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The growing tension of evolution and the clashes it engenders can
            result in one of the
            three possible outcomes to the crisis. These are (1) reform, (2) circumvention, or (3)
            reaction. We speak of reform when the organization of expansion is rearranged so that it
            ceases to be an institution and becomes an instrument once more. We speak of
            circumvention when the vested-interest groups are left with much of their privileges
            intact and when a new instrument of expansion (especially a new surplus-accumulating
            instrument) grows up alongside the older institution and takes over the latter\'s
            expansive functions. We speak of reaction when the privileged vested-interest groups are
            able to prevent either reform or circumvention and, in consequence, the rate of
            expansion continues to decrease. If the outcome is reform or circumvention, the
            civilization once again has an instrument of expansion and the rate of expansion
            increases once again. If the outcome is reaction, the decline becomes chronic. There
            have been several cases where a civilization has succeeded in obtaining reform or
            circumvention of its institution of expansion, as we shall see in our detailed
            examination of the process of evolution in individual civilizations. The clearest case
            to be found is the evolution of our Western civilization, where both circumvention and
            reform have occurred. As a result Western civilization has had three periods of
            expansion, the first about 970-1270, the second about 1420-1650, and the third about
            1725-1929. The instrument of expansion in the first was feudalism, which became
            institutionalized into chivalry. This was circumvented by a new instrument of expansion
            that we might call commercial capitalism. When this organization became
            institutionalized into mercantilism, it was reformed into industrial capitalism, which
            became the instrument of expansion of the third age of expansion in the history of
            Western civilization. By 1930 this organization had become institutionalized into
            monopoly capitalism, and the society was, for the third time, in a major era of crisis.
            A detailed analysis of these changes will be provided later.

            a close examination of this process, it becomes possible to divide the history of any

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Every civilization, indeed every society, begins with a mixture of two
            or more
            cultures. Such mixture of cultures is very common; in fact, it occurs at the boundaries
            of all cultures to some extent. But such casual cultural mixture is of little
            significance unless there comes into existence in the zone of mixture a new culture,
            arising from the mixture but different from the constituent parts. The process is a
            little like the way in which a mixture of chemicals sometimes produces a new compound
            different from the mixing chemicals. In the case we are discussing, the new compound is
            a new society with a new culture. The contributing societies may be civilizations or
            merely producing societies (agricultural or pastoral) or merely parasitic societies
            (with hunting or fishing). Of the millions of cases of such cultural mixture that are
            occurring all the time, only rarely does there appear a new society. And even more
            rarely does this new society become organized in such a way that it is a producing
            society with an instrument of expansion. In the rare case where this occurs, we have the
            first stage of a new civilization. The fact that there have been no more than two dozen
            civilizations in almost ten thousand years of cultural mixture of producing societies
            will indicate how rare this occurrence is.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since cultural mixture occurs on the borders of societies,
            civilizations rarely
            succeed one another in the same geographic area, but undergo a displacement in space.
            The process may be described somewhat as follows. Within a society, people have little
            choice as to the ways in which they will satisfy basic needs (or fulfill their
            potentialities). If they are hungry, they eat the food their associates eat, prepared in
            the fashion customarily used in their society. If they wish companionship, or a picture
            of their relationship to the universe or a relationship to God or security or shelter or
            sex or children or whatever they may wish, they obtain these desires largely in the ways
            and forms provided by their own society. But on the borders of societies there is a
            considerable mutual interpenetration of social customs, and there arise, accordingly,
            alternative ways of satisfying human needs. This is, obviously, particularly true where
            intermarriage occurs, and where decisions must be taken and choices made as to which
            customs will be followed. Such choices are imperative in regard to bringing up the
            children of mixed marriages. When this occurs far enough inside the border of a society
            for there to be a social majority and consensus, there is no real choice, and, if any
            effort is made to make a choice, the children themselves will pre-empt for the local
            consensus. But in an area of fairly equal mixture, or in an area of unequal mixture
            where the majority culture is declining and decreasing in prestige, a very real need to
            make choices arises. These choices in themselves are not very significant in forming a
            new culture, but two other considerations are important. In the first place, the many
            choices being made must be morphologically compatible in order to give rise to the
            necessary amount of integration to permit a body of social custom to arise. And, in the
            second place, a certain number of families in the same locality must make the same or
            similar choices. In this way a new society may arise. If this society is productive and
            if it becomes organized so that it has an instrument of expansion, a new civilization
            will be born.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a consequence of these conditions, civilizations have generally
            arisen on the
            periphery of earlier civilizations. Canaanite, Hittite, and Minoan civilizations arose
            on the edges of Mesopotamian civilization. Classical civilization was born on the shores
            of the Aegean Sea, especially the eastern shore, on what was the periphery of Minoan
            civilization. Western civilization arose in western Europe, especially in France, which
            was a periphery of Classical civilization. And on other peripheries of Classical
            civilization were born Russian civilization and Islamic civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If the new society born from such mixture is a civilization, it has an
            instrument of
            expansion. This means that inventions begin to be made, surplus begins to be
            accumulated, and this surplus begins to be used to utilize new inventions. Eventually,
            as a result of these actions, expansion will begin. The interval before such expansion
            becomes evident, but after the most obvious mixture has ceased, may cover generations of
            time. This period will be called the Stage of Gestation. It is Stage 2 of any
            civilization. In general, it is a period in which the society seems to be changing very
            little, and most people seem to have fairly stable status situations in the social
            structure. But, under the surface, much of importance is taking place and, above all,
            the process of investment and invention that will make possible the following period of
            expansion is taking place.

            of goods, eventually reflected in rising standards of living; (b) increase in population
            of the society, generally because of a declining death rate; (c) an increase in the
            geographic extent of the civilization, for this is a period of exploration and
            colonization; and (d) an increase in knowledge. There are intimate interrelationships
            among these four. Increase in production is aided by expanding knowledge; the growth of
            population helps to increase production as well as to extend the geographic area of the
            society; the exploration and colonization associated with this extension of the
            society\'s geographic area is made possible by the growth of production and the growth
            of
            population, both of which permit people to be released for what are, at the beginning at
            least, nonproductive activities such as exploration; the same factors allow people to be
            released to seek knowledge of various kinds or to engage in nonmaterial activities such
            as artistic or philosophic activities, while the geographic expansion in itself leads to
            substantial increases in knowledge. This period of expansion is frequently a period of
            democracy, of scientific advance, and of revolutionary political change (as the various
            levels of society become adapted to an expanding mode of life from the more static mode
            of life prevalent in Stage 2). As a result of the geographic expansion of the society,
            it comes to be divided into two areas: the core area, which the civilization occupied at
            the end of Stage 2, and the peripheral area into which it expanded during Stage 3. The
            core area of Mesopotamian civilization was the lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates
            rivers; the peripheral area was the highlands surrounding this valley and more remote
            areas like Iran, Syria, and Anatolia. The core area of Minoan civilization was the
            island of Crete; its peripheral area included the Aegean Islands and the Balkan coast.
            The core area of Classical civilization was the shores of the Aegean Sea; its peripheral
            areas were the whole Mediterranean seacoast and ultimately Spain, North Africa, and
            Gaul. The core area of Western civilization covered northern Italy, most of France, the
            Low Countries, England, and extreme western Germany; its peripheral areas included the
            rest of Europe to eastern Poland, North and South America, and Australia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When expansion begins to slow up in the core areas, as a result of the
            instrument of
            expansion becoming institutionalized, and the core area becomes increasingly static and
            legalistic, the peripheral areas continue to expand (by what is essentially a process of
            geographic circumvention) and frequently shortcut many of the developments experienced
            by the core area. As a result, by the latter half of Stage 3, the peripheral areas are
            tending to become wealthier and more powerful than the core areas. Another way of saying
            this is that the core area tends to pass from Stage 3 to Stage 4 earlier than do the
            peripheral areas. In time the instrument of expansion becomes an institution throughout
            the society, investment begins to decrease, and the rate of expansion (although not
            expansion itself) begins to decline.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As soon as the rate of expansion in a civilization begins to decline
            noticeably, it
            enters Stage 4, the Age of Conflict. This is probably the most complex, most
            interesting, and most critical of all the seven stages. It is marked by four chief
            characteristics: (a) it is a period of declining rate of expansion; (b) it is a period
            of growing tension of evolution and increasing class conflicts, especially in the core
            area; (c) it is a period of increasingly frequent and increasingly violent imperialist
            wars; and (d) it is a period of growing irrationality, pessimism, superstitions, and
            otherworldliness. The declining rate of expansion is caused by the institutionalization
            of the instrument of expansion. The growing class conflicts arise from the increasing
            tension of evolution, from the obvious conflict of interests between a society adapted
            to expansion and the vested interests controlling the uninvested surpluses of the
            institution of expansion who fear social change more than anything else. Usually there
            is a majority of the frustrated struggling against the minority of vested interests,
            although usually neither side has any clear idea of the real issues at stake or what
            would give a workable solution to the crisis. All programs for sharing the surplus of
            the few among the discontented many are worse than useless, since expansion can be
            resumed only if the three necessary elements of an instrument of expansion are provided,
            and the dissipation of surpluses among a large mass of consumers will not provide any
            one of these three necessary elements. On the contrary most revolutionary programs,
            aroused by the failure of the third element (investment), will merely make the crisis
            more acute by destroying the second element (accumulation of surplus). The only sensible
            or workable solution to the crisis of the civilization would be to reform or circumvent
            the old institution of expansion by establishing again the three basic elements of any
            instrument of expansion. Since the disgruntled masses know nothing about such things,
            and since the vested interests do not know much more and are usually concentrating their
            energies on an effort to defend their vested interests, a new instrument of expansion,
            if it appears, usually does so by accident and through the path of circumvention rather
            than by reform. If a new instrument of expansion does come into existence, the
            civilization begins to expand again, the tension of evolution and the crisis subside,
            and the civilization is once again in Stage 3.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Age of Conflict (Stage 4) is a period of imperialist wars and of
            irrationality
            supported for reasons that are usually different in the different social classes. The
            masses of the people (who have no vested interest in the existing institution of
            expansion) engage in imperialist wars because it seems the only way to overcome the
            slowing down of expansion. Unable to get ahead by other means (such as economic means),
            they seek to get ahead by political action, above all by taking wealth from their
            political neighbors. At the same time they turn to irrationality to compensate for the
            growing insecurity of life, for the chronic economic depression, for the growing
            bitterness and dangers of class struggles, for the growing social disruption and
            insecurity from imperialist wars. This is generally a period of gambling, use of
            narcotics or intoxicants, obsession with sex (frequently as perversion), increasing
            crime, growing numbers of neurotics and psychotics, growing obsession with death and
            with the Hereafter.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The vested interests encourage the growth of imperialist wars and
            irrationality
            because both serve to divert the discontent of the masses away from their vested
            interests (the uninvested surplus). Accordingly, some of the defenders of vested
            interests divert a certain part of their surplus to create instruments of class
            oppression, instruments of imperialist wars, and instruments of irrationality. Once
            these instruments are created and begin to become institutions of class oppression, of
            imperialist wars, and of irrationality, the chances of the institution of expansion
            being reformed into an instrument of expansion become almost nil. These three new vested
            interests in combination with the older vested institution of expansion are in a
            position to prevent all reform. The last of these three, the old institution of
            expansion, now begins to lose its privileges and advantages to the three institutions it
            has financed. Of these three, the institution of class oppression controls much of the
            political power of the society; the institution of imperialist wars controls much of the
            military power of the society; and the institution of irrationality controls much of the
            intellectual life of the society. These three (which may be combined into only two or
            one) become dominant, and the group that formerly controlled the institution of
            expansion falls back into a secondary role, its surpluses largely absorbed by its own
            creations. In this way, in Mesopotamian civilization, the Sumerian priesthood, which had
            been the original instrument of expansion, fell into a secondary role behind the secular
            kings it had set up to command its armies in the imperialist wars of its Age of
            Conflict. In the same way in Classical civilization the slaveowning landlords who had
            been the original instrument of expansion were largely eclipsed by the mercenary army
            that had been created to carry on the imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict but took
            on life and purposes of its own and came to dominate Classical civilization completely.
            So too the Nazi party, which had been financed by some of the German monopoly
            capitalists as an instrument of class oppression, of imperialist war, and of
            irrationality, took on purposes of its own and began to dominate the monopoly
            capitalists for its own ends.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a result of the imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict, the number
            of political
            units in the civilization is reduced. Eventually one unit emerges triumphant. When this
            occurs we are in Stage 5, the Stage of Universal Empire. Just as the core area passes
            from Stage 3 to Stage 4 earlier than the peripheral area does, so the core area comes to
            be conquered by a single state before the whole civilization is conquered by the
            universal empire. In Mesopotamia the core area was conquered by Babylonia as early as
            1700 B.C., but the whole civilization was not conquered by a universal empire until
            Assyria about 725 B.C. (replaced by Persia about 525 B.C.). In Classical civilization
            the core area was conquered by Macedonia about 330 B.C.; the whole civilization was
            conquered by Rome about 146 B.C. Western civilization has gone from Stage 3 to Stage 4
            three different times. The three Ages of Conflict are: (a) the period of the Hundred
            Years\' War, say 1300-1430; (b) the period of the Second Hundred Years\' War, say
            1650-1815; and (c) the period of war crisis that began about 1900 and still continues.
            In each case the core was conquered by an imperialist state: by England under Henry V
            about 1420, by France under Napoleon about 1810, and by Germany under Hitler about 1942.
            In the first two cases the old institution of expansion (chivalry and mercantilism) was
            circumvented by a new instrument of expansion (commercial capitalism and industrial
            capitalism), and a new period of expansion commenced. In the third case it is too early
            to see what has happened. We may be getting a new instrument of expansion that will
            circumvent monopoly capitalism and bring our civilization once again into a period of
            expansion. Or we may continue in the Age of Conflict until the whole of our civilization
            comes to be dominated by a single state (probably the United States).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the imperialist wars of Stage 4 of a civilization the more
            peripheral states are
            consistently victorious over less peripheral states. In Mesopotamian civilization the
            core states like Uruk, Kish, Ur, Nippur, and Lagash were conquered by more peripheral
            states like Agade and Babylon. These in turn were conquered by peripheral Assyria, and
            the whole of western Asia was ultimately conquered by fully peripheral Persia. In Minoan
            civilization the core area of Crete itself seems to have been conquered by peripheral
            Mycenae. In Classical civilization the core area Ionian states led by Athens were
            conquered by the semiperipheral Dorian states Sparta and Thebes, and the whole
            Greek-speaking world was then conquered by more peripheral Macedonia. Ultimately the
            whole of Classical civilization was conquered by fully peripheral Rome. In the New World
            the two isolated maize civilizations seem to provide a similar pattern. In Mesoamerica
            the core Mayan cities of Yucatan and Guatemala seem to have been overcome by the
            semiperipheral Toltecs and these, in turn, by the fully peripheral Aztecs of highland
            Mexico. In the Andes region the core area seems to have been along the coast and in the
            northern highlands of Peru. These cultures were submerged by a number of more peripheral
            cultures of which the most successful was the Tiahuanaco from the southern highlands of
            Peru. And finally, at a late date, not a century before Pizarro, the whole Andean
            civilization was conquered by the fully peripheral Incas from the forbidding central
            highlands.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In the Far East and Middle East the same sequence can be discerned.
            The core area of
            Sinic civilization was in the Huang Ho Valley. This area was conquered by Chou about
            1000 B.C. and by semiperipheral Ch\'in from the mountains of Shensi eight centuries
            later
            (221 B.C.). The whole of Sinic society was then brought into a single universal empire
            by the Han dynasty from its southern periphery (202 B.C.— A.D. 220). The Sinic
            civilization was destroyed by Hunnish nomad invaders before A.D. 400, and a new
            civilization, which we call Chinese, began to rise from the wreckage along its southern
            frontier. The core of this society seems to have been south of the Yangtze River. This
            core came under a single political rule as early as 700 under the T\'ang dynasty. Wider
            areas were added by successive dynasties of which the Yuan or Mongols were so remote
            that they can be regarded neither as peripheral nor even as Chinese (1260- 1368); the
            Ming (1368-1644) were of southern Chinese (and thus peripheral) origin; and the final
            universal empire of the Manchu (1644-1912) was from the peripheral north, Manchuria,
            with its original seat of power at Mukden.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The history of the Middle East provides similar evidence. We cannot
            speak with any
            assurance about the Indic civilization, but it seems likely that its earliest origins
            were in the lower valley (Sind) and are to be seen in the excavations at Chandu-Daro,
            while later it moved northward into the Punjab (upper valley) and found its universal
            empire in the originally peripheral Harappa area. After the destruction of this culture
            by the Aryan invaders from the northwest, the successor Hindu civilization began to
            arise (late second millennium B.C.) in the Ganges Valley. The core area of this new
            civilization fell under the political control of the local Maurya (ca. 540-184 B.C.) and
            Gupta (ca. 320-535) dynasties. Then, as Hindu culture spread over the whole Indian
            subcontinent, political dominance shifted to peripheral powers such as the
            Gurjara-Prathihara dynasty (ca. 740-1036), originating from Central Asiatic pastoral
            invaders, and a series of Moslem dynasties, mostly Turkish, at Delhi (after 1266),
            culminating in the universal empire of the Moguls (1526-1857).

            The core area of
            this civilization is to be found in western Arabia. As its culture spread over most of
            western Asia and northern Africa, political domination fell to increasingly peripheral
            dynasties: the Ommiad Caliphate, of Arabic origin, ruled from Damascus during much of
            its period (661-750), while its successor, the Abbaside Caliphate, ruled from Bagdad
            (750-ca. 930). The Seljuk Turks ruled briefly (1050-1110) from Persia and were
            ultimately succeeded by the universal empire of the Ottoman Turks with its center in
            Anatolia (1300-1922).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The victory of more peripheral states over less peripheral states
            during Stage 4 of
            any civilization seems so well established that it is worthwhile to seek the reasons for
            it. A number of these can be mentioned. In the first place, as a general rule, material
            culture diffuses more easily than nonmaterial culture, so that peripheral areas tend to
            become more materialistic than less peripheral areas; while the latter spend much of
            their time, wealth, energy, and attention on religion, philosophy, art, or literature,
            the former spend a much greater proportion of these resources on military, political,
            and economic matters. Therefore, peripheral areas are more likely to win victories. This
            contrast is quite clear between, let us say, Sumerians and Assyrians, between Ionians
            and Dorians, between Greeks and Latins, between Mayas and Aztecs, or even between
            Europeans and Americans.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;A second reason for the victories of more peripheral states arises
            from the fact that
            the process of evolution is slightly earlier in more central areas than in peripheral
            ones. Thus the central areas have already passed on to Stage 4 and may even have
            achieved a premature dress rehearsal of Stage 5 (with the achievement of a single core
            empire) while peripheral areas are still in a relatively vigorous Stage 3. Generally
            speaking, military victory is more likely to go to an area or state in Stage 3 than to
            one in any later stage, because the later stages (and the more central areas) are more
            harassed by class conflicts and are more paralyzed by the inertia and obstruction of
            institutions. Core areas generally have been ravaged for a longer period of imperialist
            wars. The combination of these obstacles gives the inhabitants of a core area a kind of
            world-weariness (sometimes called a \"failure of nerve\") that is in sharp contrast to
            their own earlier attitudes or to those of their more peripheral rivals. Accordingly,
            the task of creating a universal empire is likely to be left to such rivals.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It should be noted that in some cases, such as Egypt, Crete, or
            Russia, a single
            political unit has ruled over the civilization from its early history. This generally
            arises in civilizations whose instrument of expansion is a socialist state. In such a
            case imperialist wars are not so prevalent a characteristic of Stage 4, and the
            achievement of a single political unit (universal empire) is not one of the chief
            characteristics of that stage. As a result the stage may last a shorter time and cannot
            be so easily demarcated from earlier and later stages as can be done in civilizations
            where imperialist war and achievement of a universal empire are two of the most
            prominent marks of the stage. Absence of these items does not indicate absence of the
            stage, which is marked by its other, less easily observed, characteristics, such as
            decreasing rate of expansion, growing class conflicts, declining democracy, dying
            science, decreasing inventiveness, and growing irrationality.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When a universal empire is established in a civilization, the society
            enters upon a
            \"golden age.\" At least this is what it seems to the periods that follow it. Such a
            golden age is a period of peace and of relative prosperity. Peace arises from the
            absence of any competing political units within the area of the civilization itself, and
            from the remoteness or even absence of struggles with other societies outside.
            Prosperity arises from the ending of internal belligerent destruction, the reduction of
            internal trade barriers, the establishment of a common system of weights, measures, and
            coinage, and from the extensive government spending associated with the establishment of
            a universal empire. But this appearance of prosperity is deceptive. Little real economic
            expansion is possible because no real instrument of expansion exists. New inventions are
            rare, and real economic investment is lacking. The vested interests have triumphed and
            are living off their capital, building unproductive and blatant monuments like the
            Pyramids, the \"Hanging Gardens of Babylon,\" the Colosseum, or (as premature examples)
            Hitler\'s Chancellery and the Victor Emmanuel Memorial. The masses of the people in such
            an empire live from the waste of these non-productive expenditures. The golden age is
            really the glow of overripeness, and soon decline begins. When it becomes evident, we
            pass from Stage 5 (Universal Empire) to Stage 6 (Decay).

            able to defend
            itself because it is no longer willing to defend itself, lies wide open to \"barbarian
            invaders.\" These invaders are \"barbarians\" only in the sense that they are
            \"outsiders.\"
            Frequently these outsiders are another, younger, and more powerful civilization. The

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a result of these invasions by an outside society, the civilization
            is destroyed
            and ceases to exist. This Stage of Invasion is also a period of mixture. As such, it may
            be, but does not need to be, Stage 1 of a new civilization. This condition was true of
            several of the invasions listed above. The invasions of the Greek tribes, which ended
            Minoan civilization, marked Stage 1 of Classical civilization; the invasions of the
            Germanic tribes, which ended Classical civilization, marked Stage 1 of Western
            civilization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The seven stages are merely a convenient way of dividing a complex
            historical process.
            This process is not relentlessly deterministic at all points but merely at some points,
            in the sense that men have power and free will but their actions have consequences
            nevertheless. In general, if cultural mixture produces a new producing society with an
            instrument of expansion we have Stage 1 of a civilization. Stages 2, 3, and 4 will
            follow inevitably. This means that, if a producing society has an instrument of
            expansion, saving and investment will lead to expansion, and this expansion will
            eventually slow up as the instrument becomes an institution. At this point, in the early
            part of Stage 4 there is considerable freedom since the institutionalized instrument of
            expansion may be reformed or circumvented. If it is, expansion will be resumed, and the
            civilization will again be in Stage 3. If it is not reformed or circumvented, reaction
            will triumph, and the crisis will become worse. The choice between reform and reaction
            is not, however, a rigid one. The last part of Stage 3 may be a continual series of
            minor reforms and circumventions to the point where the creation of new instruments just
            about balances the institutionalization of old instruments and expansion continues at a
            fair rate for a considerable time. Circumvention,, especially geographic circumvention,
            may force institutions that would not otherwise have reformed to do so in order to
            compete. Thus, for example, as the textile industry of New England became
            institutionalized, new, more modern plants grew up in the South; the existence of these
            southern plants (a case of geographic circumvention) forced the textile mills of New
            England either to modernize or to perish. On a more dramatic scale the whole industrial
            system of England, in recent times, has been in an institutionalized condition and has
            been faced with the choice of reforming, thus creating new economic activities and new
            economic organizations, or perishing from the competition of peripheral areas, like the
            United States, or semiperipheral areas, like Germany (or even other civilizations, like
            Japan or India).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because of such conditions as these, the whole first part of the Age
            of Conflict
            (Stage 4) is a period of crisis and of hope. Only when the vested interests create new
            instruments of class oppression, of imperialist wars, and of irrationality, and when
            these new instruments, in turn, begin to become institutions, does hope fade. Crisis
            becomes endemic in the civilization, and continues until the universal empire with its
            golden age is established. In those civilizations that had a single political unit from
            an earlier stage, like Egyptian, Minoan, or Orthodox civilization, the Age of Conflict
            is frequently of briefer duration because imperialist wars are of limited extent. The
            fact that these one-state civilizations frequently have a socialist state as their
            instrument of expansion also serves to obscure the duration of the Age of Conflict
            because such a civilization has weak incentives to invent in its Age of Expansion and
            less dramatic class conflicts in its Age of Conflict, thus serving to obscure the
            transition from one of these stages to the other.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In theory there is nothing rigid about Stage 5. So far as observations
            of past
            civilizations indicate, every civilization passes from the Age of Conflict to the Age of
            Universal Empire. That means that one state, probably a peripheral one, emerges
            triumphant over the whole area of the civilization. But in theory it is at least
            conceivable that the competing states of Stage 4 might just fight each other down and
            down to lower and lower levels of prosperity and public order without one emerging
            triumphant over all the others. In such a case, Stage 5 might be omitted, and the
            civilization would pass directly from Stage 4 to Stage 6 (Conflict to Decay) without
            achieving any universal empire. Something like this may have been true of Mesoamerican
            civilization. In a similar way, it is conceivable, in theory, that a civilization could
            continue for a very long time in the Stage of Decay without passing on to Stage 7. For
            there can be no invasion to end the civilization unless there are invaders to come in.
            Egypt, for example, was so well protected by seas and deserts against invaders that its
            Stage of Decay lasted for more than a thousand years. It is also, in theory, conceivable
            that some universal empire some day might cover the whole globe, leaving no external
            \"barbarians\" to serve as invaders.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This point leads to one final consideration, namely, the relationship
            of outside
            societies to any civilization. In theory again, it would seem that an outside society
            that was stronger than a given civilization might at any time come in and smash it. In
            practice, however, it seems that civilizations are in little danger of such an
            experience except early or late in their careers. In general, a civilization is in no
            danger from any society except another civilization from Stage 2 to Stage 6. In Stage 6,
            however, it is in danger from any society, even a parasitic one, as is clear from the
            destruction of Cretan, Classical, Hittite, and Sinic civilizations by noncivilized
            invaders. When two civilizations collide we may use the tentative rule that the victory
            will go to the one that is closer to Stage 3 (Expansion) but that neither one will be
            destroyed unless it is in Stage 6. In 492-479 B.C. Classical civilization, in Stage 3,
            and Mesopotamian civilization, in the last part of Stage 5, collided, and the former
            won; in 336-323 they collided again, with Classical in Stage 4 and Mesopotamian in Stage
            6, and the latter was destroyed. In 264-146 B.C. Classical civilization in Stage 4 met
            Canaanite civilization in Stage 6, and destroyed it. In 711-814 Western civilization in
            Stage 2 was able to preserve itself against Islamic civilization in Stage 3; three
            hundred years later, in what we call the Crusades, Western civilization in Stage 3
            returned the visit to Islamic civilization, then in Stage 4, but could not destroy it.
            However, in 1850-1920, Western civilization, just reaching the end of Stage 3, again
            collided with Islamic civilization, now in Stage 6, and destroyed its universal empire,
            the Ottoman Empire, and probably liquidated the whole civilization, a process that is
            still going on. This was only one of several civilizations that were in a similar stage
            and that have met, or appear to be now meeting, a similar fate. The other universal
            empires in Stage 6 that have been destroyed by Western civilization while in Stage 3 are
            the Inca, the Aztec, the Manchu, the Mogul (in India), and perhaps the Tokugawa (in
            Japan). At the present time India seems to be in Stage 2 of a new civilization; China
            may be in Stage 1 of a new civilization; while the situation in Japan and in the Near
            East is still too chaotic to make any judgments about what is happening. Russian
            civilization, which began about A.D. 500 and had its period of expansion about
            1500-1900, had the state as its instrument of expansion and was just entering upon Stage
            4 in 1917 when the reform of this institution gave it a new instrument of expansion. As
            a result, Russian civilization has been in Stage 3 for the second time in recent years,
            but it remains a relatively weak civilization because of its weak incentives to
            invention. A collision between this civilization, which is early in Stage 3, and Western
            civilization, which has just begun Stage 4, would probably be indecisive in its outcome.
            If Western civilization reforms and again passes into Stage 3, it will be far too
            powerful to be defeated by Russian civilization; if Western civilization does not
            reform, but continues through the Stage of Conflict into the Stage of Universal Empire,
            the threat from Russian civilization will be much greater. However, by that time the new
            Indian civilization or the new Chinese civilization may be in Stage 3 and will present
            greater threats to both Western and Russian civilizations than either of these will
            present to the other. The possible, but by no means inevitable, relationships of these
            four civilizations in terms of the relevant stages can be seen from the following chart.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already said that civilizations are like crystals, which are
            frequently
            distorted by efforts to share the same crystalline material. They are also distorted by
            the noncrystalline material or \"matrix\" in which they are embedded. The matrix source
            from which diamonds are derived is great cylindrical pipes of friable blue clay that
            rises vertically from the remote depths of the earth to just below the surface. In this
            clay the diamonds are found embedded like currants in a fruitcake. Of course the
            diamonds in a \"pipe\" of blue clay are much less frequent than the currants in any
            acceptable piece of cake. In this they are like civilizations, which are very infrequent
            occurrences in a matrix of time, space, and noncivilized cultures.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The matrix in which civilizations occur is five-dimensional just as
            culture is. These
            include the same three dimensions of space, the fourth dimension of time, and the fifth
            dimension of abstraction. Before we make any serious attempt to apply the seven stages
            of civilization, we should have a somewhat clearer idea of this matrix in order to
            understand the distorting influences it may exercise on the seven stages of normal
            evolution in a civilization.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The three dimensions of space in which a civilization is found include
            its geographic
            environment. Since we are primarily interested in our own Western civilization and its
            direct predecessors rather than in the New World or the Far Eastern civilizations, we
            shall speak here only of the geographic matrix in which Western civilization arose. This
            area, including Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, was aptly called the
            \"Northwest Quadrant\" by the historian James Henry Breasted. Bounded on the south by
            the
            Sahara Desert along the line of latitude 20°N. and on the east by the northeast-running
            line of the Pamir, Tien Shan, and Altai Mountains, its western and northern frontiers
            are formed by the great arc of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Within this great quadrant the land mass of Afro-Eurasia has the form
            of a letter \"L\"
            which has been rotated in a clockwise direction a quarter turn. The apex of this figure
            lies in the northwest, in Europe, while one limb runs eastward into Asia and the other
            limb runs southward into Africa. Europe\'s position at the apex of these two lines has
            made it a mixing area, with the African influences more important in the prehistoric
            period and the Asiatic influences more important in the historic period. This mixing
            role of Europe has been modified also by the extreme diversity of Europe\'s terrain,
            which has given it a very convoluted coast line, creating numerous inland seas and semi
            isolated valleys that give onto the sea. The result of these two geographic influences
            has been to give Europe great diversity of both geographic conditions and cultural
            influences in a small area.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Northwest Quadrant falls into three zones, flatlands in the north
            and south being
            separated by the east-west spine of the Highland Zone. The Highland Zone is a broken
            sequence of mountains and plateaus from the Pyrenees through the Alps, Apennines, Balkan
            highlands, Carpathian Mountains, Anatolian Plateau, Caucasus, and Iranian Plateau to the
            Himalayas and the line of highlands that form the eastern boundary of the Northwest
            Quadrant. North of this Highland Zone lie the Northern Flatlands, which begin as a
            narrow wedge in the Netherlands and run eastward across the Northwest Quadrant, widening
            steadily as they move eastward so that they are only a couple of hundred miles wide in
            western Europe but broaden to almost two thousand miles wide in Asia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Southern Flatlands are opposite in pattern to the Northern
            Flatlands since they
            are broadest in the extreme west and are narrower in northeastern Africa and Arabia,
            finally falling below sea level in the extreme east to form the bottoms of the Arabian
            Sea and Indian Ocean.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This simple, and oversimplified, three-zone pattern of the Northwest
            Quadrant is
            complicated by a number of other features of which the most obvious are the inland seas,
            rivers, and mountain passes. One of the chief of these features is the Mediterranean
            Sea, which runs east and west just south of the Highland Zone. The geographic
            significance of the Mediterranean Sea, of course, is that it divides Europe from Africa,
            but its cultural significance is distinctly different because it has served to link its
            shores together rather than to divide them. This binding influence of the Mediterranean
            in the cultural sphere lasted for over 4,000 years, from the first establishment of
            distant maritime travel about 3500 B.C. to the Arab conquest of North Africa and the
            Near East about A.D. 700. During this period the techniques of water transportation were
            far more efficient and cheaper than the techniques of land travel. This superiority of
            movement by water continued for more than a thousand years after the Arab conquest, the
            technological lag of land travel beginning to close only with the invention of the
            macadam road, the coach, and the railroad after 1750. In the thousand or more years
            after 700, the linking influence of superior maritime communication in the Mediterranean
            was counterweighed by the cultural division between Moslem culture on its southern and
            eastern shores and Christian culture on its northern and western shores; but in the four
            thousand years before the Arabic conquest the technological factor was not counteracted
            by any profound cultural differences, and the shores tended to be drawn together by
            marine communication into a single cultural system. At that time the cultural division
            was not along the Mediterranean Sea but on the mountain barrier running parallel to it
            to the north. Classical civilization, especially as it grew into the Roman Empire, was
            the culmination of these influences. They were reflected in the term \"Our Sea\" (Mare
            nostrum), applied by the Romans to the Mediterranean, while the peoples north of the
            mountains (who were biologically closer relatives but culturally remote) were called
            \"barbarians\" for most of the Classical period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Less obvious than the Mediterranean were other geographical features
            of the Northwest
            Quadrant, especially those serving as interregional connections. Of these links two of
            the more significant were the \"Syrian Saddle\" and the \"Vardar-Morava route.\" The
            Syrian
            Saddle is the low pass across the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountains around the northern
            edge of the Syrian Desert just at the point where the Euphrates River approaches closest
            to the Mediterranean Sea. The mountains and deserts surrounding this \"saddle\" make it
            the only feasible route connecting the Aegean, the Mediterranean, and Egypt to the west
            with Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf to the east. In a similar fashion the
            Vardar-Morava river valleys provide a route that joins the Aegean Sea near Salonika with
            the middle Danube. The importance of these two links can be seen in the fact that such
            significant innovations as metallurgy, alphabetic writing, and Christianity came to
            Europe by way of the Syrian Saddle and the Mediterranean, while the knowledge of
            agriculture first came to Europe north of the mountains by way of the Vardar-Morava
            valley.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already said that the first civilization began in Mesopotamia
            before 5000 B.C.
            when people of the Neolithic Garden cultures moved from the Highland Zone down into the
            alluvial valley and were able to create permanent settlements because of the
            refertilizing function of the annual floods. These people are known as Sumerians. They
            were distinguished by two significant features. Physically they were a rather stocky,
            roundheaded people who seem to have worn closely clipped hair and no beards. And
            linguistically they spoke an agglutinative language related to Elamite, Hurrian, and
            other Highland Zone languages but not related either to the inflected Indo-European
            languages then forming on the Northern Flatlands or to the inflected Semite languages
            already formed on the Southern Flatlands (Arabia). This difference in language between
            the Highland Zone peoples and their neighbors in the Flatlands to the north and the
            south (at least in western Asia) was also reflected in a difference of physical type.
            The peoples of both Flatlands tended to be longheaded, wore long hair and beards, and
            were less stocky in bone structure. The peoples of the Southern Flatlands (the Semite
            speakers) were less tall, and darker in eye, hair color, and complexion than the peoples
            of the Northern Flatlands (the proto-Indo-European speakers).

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This sandwichlike arrangement of peoples on the triplezoned terrain of
            western Asia
            seems to have existed when Mesopotamian civilization was first beginning in the
            centuries before 5000 B.C. and was still in existence two thousand years later (say 3300
            B.C.) when the invention of writing and of bronze making marked the shift, at almost the
            same time, from the prehistoric to the historic period and from the Chalcolithic (or
            Copper-Stone Age) to the Bronze Age. In fact, the sandwichlike appearance of western
            Asia was, if anything, increased by 3300 B.C., because by that later date the Highland
            Zone peoples remained agriculturalists in the double sense we have indicated, while both
            the Semites to the south and the proto-Indo-Europeans to the north had adopted the care
            of domestic animals (but not the planting of crops) and had become pastoral peoples.
            There were other, less dramatic, evidences of this sandwich arrangement. For example,
            both Flatland dwellers tended to be warlike and patriarchal, and, in religion,
            emphasized the power of masculine sky gods, while the Highland dwellers tended to be
            more peaceful, more matriarchal, and had as their chief deity a goddess of fertility and
            sex who resided in the earth.

            completely inadequate in explaining the distribution of languages or of physical types
            of men. Accordingly, explanation based on geographic factors must be supplemented by
            inferences regarding the events of the prehistoric period before 3000 B.C. In making
            such inferences we have the evidence supplied by archaeology, but this in turn must be
            interpreted in terms of the sandwich pattern to be found in the later, historic period.
            Unfortunately, the areal and chronological specialization of most archaeologists and
            ancient historians has hampered them in making such inferences or even in realizing the
            need for them.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Before we present our own inferences on this matter, we should be
            quite clear what it
            is that we are seeking to do. We are trying to explain the distribution of languages,
            physical types, and social customs of western Asia as the matrix in which the earliest,
            and later, civilizations of that area appeared. Specifically, we wish to explain the
            pattern of these along the line of 45° East longitude just before 3000 B.C. This pattern
            can be summed up in the table on the next slide.
        </item>
        <item>Imageimage_6_16</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Some of this pattern can be explained in terms of fairly obvious
            geographic and social
            factors. The archaeological record shows that the earliest agriculturalists were
            Highland Zone peoples who had both domestic animals (goats, sheep, and cattle) and crop
            planting, at a time when the dwellers in both Flatlands were still hunters. The earliest
            peasants were peaceful because there was a supply of adequately watered land available
            for occupation by the limited numbers of peasants, without any need to fight for it.
            Moreover these earliest gardeners engaged in hoe culture (without plows), which was
            originally a female activity at a time when males continued to hunt. Later, as the
            development of sedentary life made hunting dwindle in significance, men became animal
            tenders, but the food for both the men and their animals was a female product.
            Furthermore, the shift from hunting to agriculture provided a rising and more secure
            standard of living that made possible, as well as desirable, an increase in population.
            This was also produced by females. The upshot of all this was that the two chief desires
            of men, that the earth should produce crops and that women should produce offspring,
            became intellectually confused into a single mystery best summed up in the word
            \"fertility.\" The reverence and desire for fertility led to a higher social and
            economic
            status for women and to the growth of new religious ideas quite different from the
            animistic religious conceptions of earlier hunting peoples. These new ideas are usually
            associated with a belief in an earth mother goddess whose confused powers of sexual and
            agrarian fertility were revered for thousands of years afterward.

            watered hills,
            parklands, and valleys of the Highland Zone and, with certain modifications, were able
            to move into alluvial river valleys and across the loess and other semiopen areas of
            Europe and Asia, but they were not able to penetrate the grassy flatlands, both North
            and South. In many places these flatlands were too arid for neolithic cultures; in more
            humid regions the grassy sod was too thick to yield to hoe culture; but, above all, most
            grassland were inhabited by savage, warlike, hunting peoples struggling for the right to
            live from the grass-eating herds of the flatlands. In the north these herds were mostly
            horses and cattle; in the south they were mostly antelope, camels, and asses. In both
            cases crop planting and the peasant way of life were excluded.

            not excluded. In
            the period before 3000 B.C., both of these diffused from the Highland Zone to the
            flatlands of Arabia and of the trans-Caspian steppes. Thus, at the dawn of history the
            peoples of those areas had made the shift from Stone Age hunting peoples to Bronze Age
            pastoral peoples, while retaining and even intensifying their warlike, patriarchal
            social system. And, naturally, their linguistic and physical characteristics remained as
            before.

            the three-zoned
            sandwich of western Asia, we must go much more deeply into the prehistory of the peoples
            involved. This will require some speculations about the origins of these peoples before
            they arrived in their respective areas of western Asia. In order to handle these
            problems, we must have a chronological system that will permit us to organize the
            population movements that brought these peoples to the places they occupied at the dawn
            of history. Such a chronology can be established in terms of climate changes.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Once again we must begin with the better-known present and work
            backward into the
            less-known past. On the oversimplified picture of the Northwest Quadrant as a threezoned
            geographic pattern, we should like to superimpose an equally simplified climate picture
            of a six-zoned pattern. This pattern is most clear on the western, oceanic border of the
            Northwest Quadrant, and is modified considerably farther east by the influence of high
            altitudes and continental land masses. From north to south the six zones are:

            1. arctic
            2. cyclonic rainfall
            3. Mediterranean
            4. desert
            5. subequatorial
            6. equatorial (or tropical)
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The nature of these six zones is well known, but the influences that
            they have
            exercised throughout history on the matrix of civilizations is not generally recognized.
            The arctic, or polar, climate is one of almost permanent frost. South of it the zone of
            cyclonic storms has adequate rainfall, coming from the west and equally distributed
            throughout the year. The third zone with Mediterranean climate and the fifth zone with
            subequatorial climate are both transition zones and have rain in half of the year and
            drought in the other half. They have the significant difference that the Mediterranean
            zone gets rainfall in the winter with drought in the summer, while the subequatorial has
            the opposite experience with rain during the summer and drought in the winter. The
            fourth zone between these two is a region of permanent desert, while the sixth, or
            southernmost, zone of tropical climate has excessive rainfall throughout the year.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The zone of equatorial rainfall is the area of low atmospheric
            pressure directly below
            the vertical rays of the sun. Because of the seasonal tipping of the earth on its axis,
            this area of vertical rays and of rainfall moves northward as far as the Tropic of
            Cancer in June and southward as far as the Tropic of Capricorn in December. It is this
            northward extension of the tropical area that creates the subequatorial zone of summer
            rains in latitudes otherwise desert. The northern belt of adequate rainfall, associated
            with the eastward moving cyclonic storms, also moves northward and southward with the
            sun, forcing the arctic zone northward in the summer and forcing the desert zone
            southward in the winter. This desert zone, holding a position between the
            cyclonic-rainfall zone of the north and the equatorial-rainfall zone of the south, is
            the area that is never reached by either of these rainy belts, while its northern and
            southern edges are reached by one or the other, in opposite seasons of the year, to
            create the two transition zones (Mediterranean and subequatorial) that we have
            mentioned.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since the rainfall of the Northwest Quadrant comes generally from the
            Atlantic in the
            west, the eastern portions of the quadrant have much less moisture even in the cyclonic
            and equatorial zones, and it is frequently quite inadequate in the two transition zones
            between these. This really means that the desert zone in the middle widens considerably
            as it stretches eastward and that the eastern portions of both the Southern Flatlands
            (Arabia) and the Northern Flatlands (Kirghiz Steppe) are generally desert.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The seasonal changes with which we are familiar are caused by the
            annual tipping of
            the earth on its axis. As a result of this, the arctic and cyclonic-rainfall zones move
            southward and then return northward, giving us winter followed by summer conditions in
            the Northern Hemisphere. For reasons we do not yet understand, this movement southward
            of the first two zones was greatly exaggerated and long maintained on four separate
            occasions during the last 900,000 years. By \"greatly exaggerated\" we mean that arctic
            conditions extended southward as far as the Highland Zone, while the cyclonic storms
            followed tracks across the Southern Flatlands over what is today the Sahara Desert. By
            \"long maintained\" we mean that these exaggerated winter conditions continued for tens
            of
            thousands of years, probably for as long as 75,000 years at a time. These periods of
            extreme cold are known as the glacial ages.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There have been four of these glacial ages of Europe in the vicinity
            of the Alps,
            although probably fewer in some other areas. In southern Germany, where they have been
            most studied, the four glaciers have been given Alpine names: Gunz, Mindel, Riss, and
            Wurm. These names are sometimes applied to the glacial periods in other areas, although
            it will be just as convenient to speak of them by numbers from one to four. The periods
            between the glaciers, when there were temperate or even semitropical conditions in
            Europe, are called interglacial periods and are also numbered. The period in which we
            live, following the fourth glacier, is known as the postglacial period, or, more
            technically, as the Holocene. If we were to assume that a fifth glacial period might
            occur in the future, it would probabl be more accurate to call the Holocene, in which we
            live, the fourth interglacial period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Each glacial period lasted for about 75,000 years. The interglacial
            periods were not
            of uniform length, the first and third lasting for about 150,000 years, while the
            second, or \"Great Interglacial,\" lasted almost twice as long. If we add together the
            lengths of the four glacials, the three interglacials, and the postglacial, we obtain a
            total of about 920,000 years. This period of something less than a million years happens
            also to be the period in which man in a biological form somewhat like our own has been
            on this earth. The whole million-year epoch is called the Quaternary Age, while the
            major portion of it, during which the glaciers were advancing and retreating, is known
            as the Pleistocene.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;During the glacial periods when Europe was under arctic conditions and
            the Sahara was
            under pluvial conditions, the former was an undesirable place for human residence, while
            the latter was well adapted to man. In the interglacial periods when the pluvial zone
            had moved northward and the Sahara had become desert, Europe was a desirable place for
            human habitation, while the African flatlands became almost uninhabitable. For this
            reason the pluvial and interpluvial periods of African history are even more significant
            than the contemporary glacial and interglacial periods of European history. In effect,
            man followed the pluvial zone north into Europe and south into Africa four times during
            the Pleistocene era. Of course, the movement of people was considerably less than this
            implies. In reality, relatively few persons followed the rain belt north and south, and
            these moved so slowly that they were probably unaware that they were moving. As Africa
            became drier with the approach of an interglacial period, the grass became scantier and
            grasseating game animals fewer. The human population, which had increased substantially
            there in the preceding, more lush, pluvial period, dwindled in numbers and moved both
            northward and southward in search of more adequate hunting grounds. The majority,
            unsuccessful in this search, perished, either from lack of food or in combat with other
            tribesmen for control of the diminishing hunting grounds. Those who moved south mostly
            died in an effort to deal with the inhospitable tropical jungles. Those who moved
            northward had a similar fate along the southern shores of the Mediterranean seas, except
            for the comparatively small number who could find a way northward across Sinai and the
            Levant to the Highland Zone and the Northern Flatlands beyond. It has been suggested
            that the glacial age tied up so much water in the form of ice on the northern land
            surfaces that the level of the ocean fell sufficiently to create land bridges between
            Europe and Africa at Gibraltar and Sicily. It is quite true that sea levels were
            considerably lower during the glacial periods, but it is doubtful that this was ever
            sufficient to open trans-Mediterranean land bridges, at least for any very long time.

        <item>Imageimage_6_30</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This whole process of population growth and movement was reversed at
            the onset of a
            glacial period. In the preceding interglacial age the population of Europe, especially
            on the grassy Northern Flatlands, must have reached a maximum because of the adequate
            supply of herding game animals, while in the Southern Flatlands desert conditions must
            have reduced grass, animals, and men to a minimum. As the advancing glacier moved
            southward, preceded by the pluvial zone, living conditions in Europe worsened and
            population became reduced, either by emigration or by death, while the population of the
            Southern Flatlands, largely from more successful biological reproduction, increased.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It should be clearly understood that all these great changes took
            thousands of years
            and occurred so slowly that the individual persons involved could have had no
            realization that they were concerned with the processes we have described. They knew
            nothing of moving glaciers or rain belts and had no glimmering conception that they were
            one generation in a family line that was migrating successfully or was perishing
            locally. This is clearly one case where the historical events we describe were occurring
            to statistical masses rather than to isolated individual persons.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Although migration was only a minor portion of the population changes
            of the
            Pleistocene, we may picture the glaciers as a great piston that advanced and withdrew
            four times, expelling population from Europe as it advanced and sucking it back again
            from Africa as it withdrew northward. This fundamental but oversimplified picture must
            now be modified by two other considerations. The first of these arises from the fact
            that glacial advance came down altitudes as well as latitudes, while the second arises
            from the fact that such glacial movements were not steady but fluctuating.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When we say that glaciers advanced down the altitudes as well as down
            the latitudes,
            we mean that glacial advance not only consisted of a southward advance of the polar
            icecap; it also consisted of a downward extension of the snow line on mountain peaks.
            The latter movement, on the northern side of mountain ranges like the Alps, Caucasus, or
            Himalayas, appeared as a northward advance of ice. More significant for human history is
            the fact that the lowering of the snow line closed mountain passes while the lower
            altitudes to the north were still habitable, thus trapping groups of people north of the
            mountain barriers in the face of the advancing Ice Age. These trapped peoples were able
            to survive only if they could adapt their social customs to living under glacial
            conditions. This would have required, as a minimum, the acquisition of fire and the use
            of clothing. Since these people would have been separated from the main stock of mankind
            in Africa for a long period, at least 100,000 years, it is almost inevitable that they
            would have become changed in physical features and that these changes would be those
            such as shorter neck and limbs, chunkier body, thicker hair, narrower nostrils,
            protected eye sockets, and other modifications helpful in living under arctic
            conditions.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The development of such a distinctive type of man did occur, at least
            once, probably
            in eastern Asia north of the Himalayas, during the second or third glacial age. This
            type is called Neanderthal man.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Neanderthal man was so different in appearance from most modern men
            that no observer
            would be likely to confuse them. His bodily proportions were quite different, since he
            had shorter legs and almost no neck. There were other, more technical, differences. His
            rib bones were rounder, rather than flattened as ours are; he had no real chin or
            forehead; his eyes were protected by bony eye ridges along the brows; and his head was
            attached to the front rather than to the top of the last vertebra.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because of these differences, Neanderthal man is frequently regarded
            as a different
            species from modern man, or Homo sapiens. But he is more correctly regarded as a
            variety, since the critical mark of species difference, inability to interbreed to
            produce fertile offspring, was not true of the Neanderthal and Homo sapiens types. It is
            now generally recognized that these two were able to interbreed and leave descendants on
            those rare occasions when they encountered each other along the margins of their
            customary habitats. Such encounters were on the margins of their ranges because Homo
            sapiens lived under temperate conditions, while Neanderthal man lived under semiglacial
            conditions. They both lived in Europe but at different times. Homo sapiens retreated to
            Africa when Europe was glacial, thus abandoning Europe to Neanderthal man, while the
            latter retreated northeastward toward Asia, where he had originated, as the interglacial
            period commenced. Just as we associated the movements of Homo sapiens with the movements
            of a glacial piston that ejected him from Europe or sucked him back from Africa, so we
            could associate the movements of the same piston with Neanderthal man, who came into
            Europe with the glacier and retreated with it toward northern Asia when it departed.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Because of the conceit of normal egotism, it is customary to regard
            Homo sapiens as of
            higher intellectual capacity than Neanderthal man. This is a matter on which real
            evidence is scanty, but the evidence that is available would clearly indicate that
            Neanderthal man was at least as intelligent as Homo sapiens. This evidence includes the
            following: Neanderthal man possessed both fire and clothing, necessities for glacial
            living, before Homo sapiens did. He seems to have buried his dead, leaving with the body
            equipment needed in some future life, at an earlier period, thus giving evidence of an
            earlier recognition of spiritual values. His tools were frequently made in greater
            variety and with somewhat greater skill, and include the earliest compound tools (in
            which the blade and handle were separate pieces). But these achievements, which might be
            interpreted to indicate a fairly high level of brain power, apparently do not indicate
            sufficient mental flexibility to permit Neanderthal man to survive the ending of glacial
            conditions. By adapting his way of life so successfully to glacial conditions and to the
            pursuit of the great glacial mammals such as mammoths, Neanderthal man made his way of
            life too rigid to permit him to exist under postglacial conditions when such mammals
            became extinct.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have suggested that Neanderthal man developed as an offshoot from
            the main line of
            human evolution by being trapped by a glacial age north of the mountains in Asia. We do
            not know whether the glacier that did this was the second (Mindel) or the third (Riss),
            but it is clear that Neanderthal man was alone in Europe during the early portion of the
            fourth, Wurm, glacier.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The fourth glacier had two icy peaks known as Wurm I and Wurm II. The
            interval between
            them, known as Achen, occurred when the glacier withdrew part way and then returned with
            full intensity in the phase called Wurm II (or Buhl). The withdrawal of Wurm I gave rise
            to the usual population movements that we have posited of a glacial retreat, Neanderthal
            man withdrawing toward Asia while Homo sapiens began to move to Europe from Africa. With
            the return of Wurm II, this process was reversed; but this time, probably for the first
            time, some Homo sapiens groups were able to remain in Europe under glacial conditions by
            adopting the techniques of fire, fur clothing, and cave dwelling that had been developed
            by Neanderthal man. Thus, for the first time, especially during the early stages of the
            withdrawal of Wurm II, Homo sapiens and Neanderthal man came into close biological
            contact, with consequent interbreeding. This occurred on the fringes of Asia and Europe,
            north and east of the Mediterranean Sea, and may have occurred south of the sea in parts
            of North Africa. As a consequence, the early postglacial period found three human types
            in the Northwest Quadrant, Neanderthal in northern Europe retreating toward Asia, Homo
            sapiens in the Southern Flatlands moving toward Asia and Europe (largely by way of the
            Levant), and a mixed group in between, chiefly in the Highland Zone of the Caucasus and
            Iran. It is probable that we owe the later existence of a stocky, roundheaded,
            agglutinative-speaking people in the Highland Zone to the existence of this mixed group.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This does not mean that the mixed group stayed in the Highland Zone.
            They undoubtedly
            moved along it, both east and west, even before the final glacial withdrawal began.
            Then, as this withdrawal became definite, this mixed group moved northward and eastward,
            hunting reindeer and cold-loving animals. They were following on the heels of the pure
            Neanderthal, who was moving in the same direction, closer to the glacier\'s edge, and
            still hunting mammoths, mastodons, and other glacial fauna soon to become extinct.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the same time, other mixed persons remained in the Highland Zone
            and its adjacent
            parklands, hunting such temperate animals as deer, elk, and the great European wild
            cattle. This last group we may call by the name Alpine men, a term which refers to their
            physical type. They spoke agglutinative languages of which the only surviving remnants
            are Basque and certain archaic languages of the Caucasus. The other mixed group that
            followed the reindeer northeastward were of a similar physical type, but may be called
            by the linguistic term proto-Finnish. These were the linguistic ancestors of the
            Ural-Altaic languages such as Finnish, Turkish, Magyar, Mongolian, and probably Chinese
            (now greatly modified by new vocabulary and the isolation of the meaningful syllables
            whose gluing together is one of the chief features of agglutinative languages). These
            languages are frequently called Ural-Altaic because they were centered, in historic
            times, in the area between the Ural and Altai mountains just east of the center from
            which the Indo-European (inflected) languages dispersed.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The early postglacial dispersal of agglutinative-speaking roundheads
            on the heels of
            the departing Neanderthal was soon disrupted by the arrival of a new wave from Africa.
            During Wurm II the Sahara grasslands had built up a fairly numerous population of the
            familiar Mediterranean physical type: longheaded, slim-boned, rather dark-skinned, with
            dark eyes and hair. The appearance of postglacial arid conditions in the central Sahara
            split this group, pushing some southward toward the southern grasslands of the
            subequatorial climate zone and driving the rest northward toward the retreating belt of
            cyclonic storms. The group that moved southward mixed with earlier travellers in that
            direction, became darker-skinned and taller, while remaining longheaded, giving rise to
            negroid groups. The group that moved northward eventually crossed the Sinai Peninsula
            and the Levant. Those who remained in Arabia became the ancestors of the longheaded,
            slim speakers of inflected languages whom we call Semites. Those who continued
            northward, across the Caucasus into the Northern Flatlands, became the ancestors of the
            longheaded, slim speakers of inflected languages whom we call Indo-Europeans.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The latter group, the proto-Indo-Europeans, moved slowly
            northwestward, becoming
            taller and paler-skinned as they moved. They drove a wedge of tall, inflected-language
            longheads between the agglutinative-speaking proto- Finnish to the northeast and the
            agglutinative-speaking Alpines in the Highland Zone to the south and southwest. At a
            fairly recent date, in the northwestern extremity of their range, these intrusive
            Indo-European speakers became very tall, blond, fair-skinned, and blue-eyed in that
            Scandinavian type known as Nordic. Their ancestors remaining on the southeastern steppes
            stayed much less Nordic in physical type, since that type is an extreme aberrant
            probably caused by the lessened amounts of ultraviolet radiations in the cloud-shrouded
            northwestern sunlight.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Thus in the immediate postglacial period, during a rather dry and cold
            climate, the
            Northwest Quadrant had seven different types of peoples distributed in rough bands from
            the extreme northeast in Asia to the extreme southwest in Africa. These bands were the
            following: (1) Neanderthal, moving to extinction on the shores of the Arctic Ocean; (2)
            a mixed group of agglutinative-speaking roundheads moving eastward across Asia at a
            rather high latitude and leaving behind the ancestors of the Ural-Altaic peoples as well
            as those of the Mongols, Eskimos, and American Indians; (3) the longheaded,
            inflective-speaking proto-Indo- European group moving northwestward from the Kirghiz
            Steppes toward Scandinavia where it would develop into the Nordic type; (4) the Highland
            Zone Alpine, an agglutinative- speaking roundhead; (5) the Mediterranean type, an
            inflective-language longhead, on the northern fringes of the Southern Flatlands; (6) the
            negroid, a tall longhead, resident in the subequatorial grasslands and the edges of the
            equatorial forests; and (7) the pygmy, a very short, yellow skinned roundhead, living in
            the equatorial forest itself. Of these groups the oldest by far is the last, since the
            pygmy goes back to a very early period, considerably before the six other types had
            developed, and probably shares, in that remote period, a common ancestry with the group
            from which the glacial-entrapped Neanderthals emerged.

        <item>Imageimage_6_46</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If we leave aside the pygmy as an ancient aberrant created by
            isolation in a sunless
            hot climate, and widen our field of geographic concern, for a moment, to include the
            whole Old World hemisphere, we might make three observations. In the first place, the
            Old World linguistic pattern, in the terms we are using, is fairly simple. At the
            center, as a recent emergent from the Southern Flatlands, we find a great core of
            inflected languages divided into two main groups of Semite and Indo-European. Around
            this core, as an earlier emergent from the same prolific Southern Flatlands, is a band
            of agglutinative-speaking languages, also divided into two groups, the Ural-Altaic of
            central Asia and the Bantu of grassland Africa. And last, at the two extremes, in the
            Far East of Asia and in the west of grassland Africa, are two blocs of isolating
            languages that probably arose from the syllabic disintegration of the oldest
            agglutinative languages. It might be added that at the dawn of history (about 3000 B.C.)
            this pattern was further complicated by the Highland Zone block of agglutinative
            speakers separating the two inflective groups, the Semites and Indo-Europeans. One of
            the great events of the historic period has been the linguistic submergence of these
            Alpine agglutinatives by the longheaded inflective speakers, especially by
            Indo-Europeans, as a consequence of population movements engendered by two acute dry
            spells of the historic period.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Our second observation is concerned with Africa. The earliest
            postglacial climate
            period, called the Boreal (about 14,000 to 6000 B.C.), was dry and cool. Its dryness
            resulted in the depopulation of the African Flatlands, already mentioned. In the
            subsequent wetter period known as the period of Atlantic climate (6000 B.C. to 3000
            B.C.), there was a movement of population back into the area, chiefly from Arabia. The
            people who moved westward across Africa under these influences are called Hamites.
            Later, in the subsequent drier period after 3000 B.C., a second and larger movement from
            Arabia into Africa was made by Semite peoples. Both of these peoples had profound
            influences on the negroid peoples of the African grasslands and on the complex mixed
            peoples of Egypt and Ethopia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Our third observation is concerned with a group that is now
            linguistically extinct and
            may appear to many as of little historic significance. These are the
            agglutinative-speaking Alpine peoples of the Highland Zone. This group, which usually
            receives only passing references in most histories, are, in fact, the most important
            group of humans who ever existed. They were the inventors of agriculture as we know it,
            using the same crops and domestic animals we have today. They were also the inventors of
            metallurgy (copper, bronze, and possibly iron) and were the founders of the first
            civilization, in the valley of Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From these last remarks it must be clear that climate change continued
            to determine
            the chronological pattern of events even in the postglacial period. This is correct.
            Following the Boreal period (14,000-6000 B.C.) we find great cultural significance in a
            period of warmer and drier climate from about 2500 to about 1000 B.C. This period,
            called the Sub-Boreal, was preceded and followed by periods of more adequate rainfall.
            The earlier of these, known as Atlantic climate, lasted from about 6000 B.C. to 2500
            B.C., while the later, known as the Sub-Atlantic, lasted from about 1000 B.C. to about
            A.D. 200. In these two periods of more plentiful rainfall, the Northern and Southern
            Flatlands, especially in Arabia and on the Kirghiz Steppes, had a more plentiful supply
            of grass and thus supported more numerous herds of grazing animals and larger numbers of
            men. In the intervening Sub-Boreal period, as well as during the drier period after A.D.
            200 (for about a thousand years), the increased drought reduced the grass and the
            grazing herds and forced the tribesmen who lived off these to migrate out of these
            Flatlands toward the Highland Zone and the Mediterranean. One of the master patterns of
            the chronology of postglacial human history in the Northwest Quadrant was this fourstage
            sequence of climate change that saw each of two periods of adequate rainfall and
            relatively sedentary populations followed by a period of inadequate rainfall and
            devastating tribal migrations. The explosive qualities of the two drier periods
            following 2500 B.C. and A.D. 200 were intensified by the fact that the earlier periods
            of adequate rainfall, following 6000 B.C. and 1000 B.C., had greatly increased the
            density of population in the Flatlands and thus intensified the movement of peoples when
            the climate finally became drier.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It should be noted that the dates given for these climate changes are
            those that apply
            to the Northern Flatlands (and thus to Eurasia) and that the corresponding changes in
            the Southern Flatlands of Sahara-Arabia occurred a little earlier.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The most notable consequence of the Sub-Boreal dry period following
            2500 B.C. and of
            the post-Classical dry period following A.D. 200 has been the outpouring of peoples from
            Arabia and from the areas around and to the east of the Kirghiz Steppes. During both dry
            periods the peoples who moved out of Arabia are called Semites. In the earlier dry
            period the peoples who moved out of the Northern Flatlands were Indo-Europeans, while
            those who moved out of this area during the later dry period were Ural-Altaic speakers.

            post-Classical dry
            periods did not emerge in any constant or steady stream but rather came in waves. These
            waves went in three chief directions: (1) southwestward into Africa; (2) westward into
            the Levant (Palestine and Syria); and (3) eastward into Mesopotamia (Iraq). We shall say
            nothing more about the ones who went into Africa, but those who went into the Levant and
            Mesopotamia are too significant to be neglected even in the most cursory examination of
            Old World history. These two areas together form a semicircle, open to the south, around
            the Arabian Desert, and called by Breasted \"the Fertile Crescent.\" This crescent, like
            a
            great horseshoe curving northward, has its western leg resting on the head of the Red
            Sea near Aqaba, while its eastern leg rests on the head of the Persian Gulf. Any
            movement of peoples out of Arabia by land would be into the Fertile Crescent.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;There have been four such waves bringing newcomers either into the
            Levant on the west
            or into Mesopotamia on the east. Although these emigrants were quite closely related to
            one another, they are usually known by different names in the two halves of the Fertile
            Crescent even in the same outward movement.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The first wave of emigrants into the Levant, just before 3000 B.C.,
            are simply called
            Semites, while their brothers who moved eastward are called Akkadians in the middle
            valley and Assyrians in the northern valley. The secondwave, just before 2000 B.C., are
            known as Canaanites in the Levant and as Amorites in Mesopotamia. In the course of the
            second millennium B.C., various branches of these two groups became distinguished in
            different areas so that some of the Canaanites came to be known as Ugarites,
            Phoenicians, and Hebrews, while some of the Amorites came to be called Babylonians. The
            third wave out of Arabia brought people known as Arameans in the Levant and as Chaldeans
            in Mesopotamia. The fourth wave, which began about A.D. 600, were known as Arabs in both
            areas. The chronological relationships among these various groups of Semites can be seen

            profound effects
            upon the history of civilizations. The Canaanites became the chief element in a
            civilization of their own, known as Canaanite civilization, which lasted for almost 2000
            years, ending with the destruction of Punic culture by the Romans about 100 B.C. The
            Arabs also came to form a distinct civilization, called Islamic, which lasted about 1400
            years and ended with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire in the twentieth century. The
            other peoples named (Akkadians, Amorites, Arameans, Chal-deans, and Assyrians) played
            varied roles in that most venerable of civilizations, Mesopotamian, which originated in
            the activities of a non-Semite people, the Sumerians, and ended with the imperial
            achievements of another non-Semite people, the Persians.

            the roles we
            have mentioned, even greater activities were being performed by the Indo-European
            peoples who were emerging from the drying Northern Flatlands. These peoples pushed out
            from the Flatlands in two waves, of which the earlier are called the Bronze Age
            invaders, while the others, 800 years or so later, are known as the Iron Age invaders.
            These two waves, shortly after 2000 B.C. and again shortly before 1000 B.C., were both
            results of Sub-Boreal climate changes, and consisted of Indo-European- speaking peoples.
            A third wave, after A.D. 200, contained a considerable number of other Indo-European
            speakers, notably the Germans, but the original impetus came from the pressure of
            Ural-Altaic speakers. Of these Ural-Altaic speakers who pushed out of the Asiatic
            Flatlands after A.D. 200, the earliest were the Huns. These were followed, during the
            next thousand years, by other Ural- Altaic-speaking peoples such as the Avars, Bulgars,
            Magyars (Hungarians), Mongols (or Tartars), and Turks.

            might be because these movements sent peoples into many geographic areas, in each of
            which they are known by a different name. The earlier, or Bronze Age, invaders, about
            1800 B.C., originated in the Flatlands north of the Caspian Sea and sent peoples into
            areas extending from central or western Europe to India. The later, or Iron Age,
            invaders, about 1100 B.C., originated northwest of the Black Sea and sent peoples into
            areas from central Europe to Palestine, but not farther east. As a result we must
            include in our table nine different regions, as follows:

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Europe itself the third millennium B.C., especially the latter half
            of it, saw the
            most important changes in all Europe\'s history. The preceding period of warm, moist
            climate had continued for over three thousand years, and led to the growth of thick
            forests that broke up the human inhabitants into small isolated bands dwelling in the
            rare open sites on the banks of rivers or on the shores of lakes and seas. The herds of
            grass-eating animals almost disappeared, and the highly successful paleolithic way of
            life in which man was a hunter of big game was replaced by a sedentary way of life in
            which man was a gleaner, a fisherman, or a hunter of small game in wooded terrain. This
            new way of life, known as the mesolithic, lasted about three thousand years (6000- 3000
            B.C.) and was also found on the western fringes of Asia and the northern fringes of
            Africa where the increase in rainfall was also evident. This mesolithic culture is
            regarded by most writers as a retrogression from the much more dramatic big-game hunting
            of an earlier period, but it seems to me that this is a mistaken point of view. It is
            also generally considered to be a local, European, development which seems to be equally
            wrong.

        <item>Imageimage_6_62</item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;My own opinion on the mesolithic is that it was a period of progress
            to a higher
            culture, in terms of technology and human productivity, and that it was not a local
            invention but rather came in from the tropical forest zone where a somewhat similar way
            of life must have existed for a considerable period. There is no space here for the
            rather technical arguments that would support this theory of mesolithic diffusion from a
            tropical forest area, but it is possible to mention the kind of evidence that would be
            used.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Pin Hole Cave in England, just at the level where the mesolithic
            evidence begins,
            was found an Indian Ocean cowrie shell. Obviously, if a shell could come that distance,
            some of the new techniques of mesolithic culture could come the same route. Or again,
            Europe\'s first domestic animal, the dog, whose origins seem to go back to southeast
            Asia, arrived just at the beginning of the mesolithic period. This animal, well adapted
            to small-game forest hunting and to the sedentary, trash-accumulating life of the
            mesolithic, could have come by the same route as the cowrie shell. Moreover, in the very
            late mesolithic period in Europe there appeared two other domestic animals, the fowl and
            swine. Both of these are of Asiatic tropical forest origin and thus have quite a
            distinct source from the later Highland Zone domestic animals associated with early
            peasant agriculture. These later animals, such as sheep, goats, and cattle, are
            grass-eating Highland Zone herd animals, and are not tropical forest gleaners as are the
            chicken and pig.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Mesolithic technology had a much reduced concern with stone tools and
            a greatly
            increased concern with fiber cords and wickerwork. It included fish lines and fishhooks,
            nets and weirs, snares, bows and arrows, permanent huts of wicker and mud (or, as the
            English say, \"wattle-and-daub\"), basketry, canoes and paddles and, toward the end of
            the
            period (4000 B.C.), crude pottery and even some crop planting. The evidence for this new
            mesolithic technology, which has recently been described by J. G. D. Clark of Cambridge
            University, is often to be found in shell heaps and trash mounds (\"kitchen midden\")
            associated with the mesolithic\'s sedentary settlements.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the end of the third millennium B.C., this mesolithic way of life
            was disrupted by
            a series of events that pushed European societies forward to new economic levels. About
            2700 B.C., a cultural movement from the Levant or southern Anatolia had arrived in
            southeastern Spain by way of the Mediterranean. This movement, sometimes called the
            megalithic movement, brought to Europe a number of cultural innovations, of which the
            chief was the use of metal (copper and bronze). From southwestern Spain, near Almeria,
            these innovations spread to Europe by two subsidiary routes. While the megalithic
            movement went on to western Europe by sea, crossing the Atlantic waters and the Bay of
            Biscay to Britanny (2500 B.C.) and the narrow seas to Britain and Denmark (2200 B.C.),
            groups of Spanish origin, called the Bell-Beaker people, moved northward, across the
            Pyrenees and southern France, to northern Italy, Switzerland, and central Europe by
            land.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At the very time that the megalithic and Bell-Beaker movements were
            bringing metals to
            Europe from the west, the Neolithic Garden cultures were bringing Highland Zone peasant
            agriculture to Europe from the east. This innovation first appeared, according to the
            available evidence, in the Western Asiatic Highland Zone, possibly near Armenia, in the
            seventh millennium B.C. As we have already indicated, the search for fertile plots of
            semiopen parklands resulted in a steady diffusion of this culture and its peoples.
            Crossing Anatolia and the Aegean Sea, they were in northeastern Greece by 3500 and then
            proceeded, by way of the Vardar-Morava route, to the middle Danube. While some descended
            the river to Romania and Bessarabia, where further passage was blocked by the warlike
            hunters of the steppes, others moved upstream across the loess lands of Hungary to
            Austria, the shores of Swiss lakes, and the Upper Rhine. Down the Rhine they proceeded
            to the lower valley whence they fanned out, going eastward across southern Germany and
            westward across northern France. By 2200 the latter branch had crossed into England, and
            within a few generations the central European branch was moving into Denmark from the
            south.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In this way both agriculture and metals had penetrated to western and
            central Europe
            before the onset of Sub-Boreal climate brought in the Bronze Age horse-using
            Indo-European warrior peoples from the eastern steppes. The arrival of these new people
            and of drier Sub-Boreal climate led to a drastic reorganization of Europe\'s societies.
            The climate change, by 2000 B.C., opened the forests of Europe, so that megalithic
            traders abandoned the seaways of the west in all of southwestern Europe as far east as
            the Adriatic and as far north as Britanny and, instead, crossed Europe by boat on the
            rivers, bringing Irish gold, Cornish tin, and Danish amber across Bohemia and southern
            Germany to the Danube. Down this river they went to the mouth of the Morava where they
            split, some continuing down the Danube, while others turned south to the Isthmus of
            Corinth and the Gulf of Argos beyond. In Argos, the new commercial cities of Mycenae and
            Tiryns welcomed the northern traders and grew rich from their commerce, which continued
            on, by sea, to Crete, to Egypt, or to the Syrian Saddle. Those traders who had continued
            down the Danube crossed Thrace to receive an equally warm welcome in Troy, whence the
            trade routes continued across Hittite Anatolia and the Assyrian outposts in Cilicia to
            the Syrian Saddle and Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These European trade routes of the Sub-Boreal period were not
            disrupted, but were
            rather developed, by the arrival of the Indo-European warrior peoples in central Europe
            about 2000 B.C. From the neolithic peasant peoples these conquerors extracted food, and
            from the megalithic traders they extracted tribute, using the surplus accumulated to
            exploit the bronze-making resources of Bohemia in forest forges. From this system
            emerged a prosperous, barbaric (but not civilized) culture known as the Great Central
            European Bronze Age. This culture reached its peak about 1400 B.C., with northern and
            western connections to megalithic Ireland, England (Stonehenge), and Denmark, and even
            more significant connections to Terremare Italy, Mycenaean Greece, and Hittite Anatolia.
            These southern and eastern connections were with similar Indo-European Bronze Age
            invaders in other areas. The whole system was destroyed by the onslaught of
            Indo-European Iron Age invaders about 1200 B.C. These later peoples exploded out of the
            northern Balkans with devastating force, and established in various areas the Celtic
            speakers of central and western Europe, the Dorian speakers of Greece, and a variety of
            Anatolian peoples, such as Phrygians and Carians. In the Aegean and Balkans these Iron
            Age invaders ended Cretan civilization forever and established a Dark Age that lasted
            for several centuries. This Dark Age, centering on the period 1000 B.C., marks the
            transition between Cretan civilization and its descendant Classical Mediterranean
            civilization, performing a double role as the period of invasion of the former (Stage 7)
            and as the period of mixture of the other (Stage 1).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Farther east the same Indo-European population movements performed
            different roles in
            other civilizations. In Anatolia the Bronze Age Hittite invaders who came in over the
            Caucasus across Armenia acted as Stage 1 of Hittite civilization (1900 B.C.), while the
            Iron Age invaders from Thrace destroyed and ended this civilization a short eight
            hundred years later, providing the limits to the briefest and least known of all major
            civilizations.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Iron Age invaders of the Aegean area, whom we have called by
            different names in
            the Balkans and in western Anatolia, drove fleeing before them a mixed group of earlier
            inhabitants of those shores, including Achaeans, Etruscans (Trojans), Cretans, some
            Dorians, and various dimly known peoples of the Anatolian shore. This mixed group
            crossed the Mediterranean and became the unsuccessful Iron Age invaders of Egypt. In two
            amphibious assaults on the Nile Delta, one about 1221 and the second about 1194, they
            were thrown back by Egyptian forces under the leadership of the Pharaoh, Ramses III.
            Thus repulsed, they scattered on the Mediterranean shores to seek new homes. Egyptian
            pictures, which show their Viking-like ships, and accompanying inscriptions give us the
            most specific evidence we have of these tumultuous events. The written evidence tells us
            the names of some of the frustrated invaders, including in the enumeration such
            intriguing terms as Sarda, Sicani, and others. It has been suggested that subsequent
            settlements of these refugees in the western Mediterranean gave Sardinia and Sicily
            their names and may have brought the Etruscans from an original home near Troy to
            Tuscany on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

            Iron Age
            invaders who fell back from the unsuccessful assault on Egypt and turned eastward to
            land on the more weakly defended coasts of Canaanite Levant. This group, known to us
            from biblical records as Philistines, gave their name permanently to the area we call
            Palestine.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Eight centuries before the Philistines came into the Levant from the
            west by sea,
            Bronze Age invaders had come down into the Levant from the north by land. This was part
            of the great flood of Indo-European pastoral peoples who broke over the Caucasus from
            the Northern Flatlands about 1900 B.C. As this flood crossed Armenia to enter Kurdistan,
            it split into three branches. The branch that turned sharply west into Anatolia became
            the Hittites. The branch that continued south underwent complicated changes. Originally
            Indo-European, it pushed ahead of it a large mass of Highland Zone roundheaded
            agglutinative speakers who are frequently called Hurrians, and these, as the flood
            continued southward, began to push before them a mass of Semitespeaking peoples. Of
            these peoples, the advance guard, largely Semite, invaded Egypt, where they are known as
            Hyksos. The middle mass, chiefly Hurrian, spread over much of the Levant, and are
            frequently mentioned in the Old Testament as Hurri, Hivites, or even \"Hittites.\" The
            driving rear-guard of this movement, mostly Indo-European, settled on the Syrian Saddle
            as exploitative tribute gatherers and breeders of horses for much of the Near East. They
            are known as Mitanni. An offshoot of this migration, more Hurrian than Indo-European,
            moved down into Mesopotamia and set up numerous local kingships known as Kassites
            (1650-1300). These peoples were gradually absorbed into the basically Semitic population
            of the river valley over the next few centuries.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;East of Mesopotamia, where the later Iron Age invasions did not reach,
            the influence
            of the earlier Bronze Age invasions are well known. In the first three centuries of the
            second millennium these peoples moved southward and eastward from the Caspian Steppes.
            Those who settled in Iran were known later as Medes and Persians, but played no great
            role in history until the sixth century B.C. when they took over political domination of
            Mesopotamian civilization from the Chaldeans in the last stages of that civilization.
            Further east the Bronze Age invaders of India, known as Aryans, destroyed the Indus
            civilization and instigated a period of turmoil that was Stage 7 of Indic civilization
            and Stage 1 of Hindu civilization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The events described in this chapter, performed on the three-zoned
            Northwest Quadrant
            within a chronology based on climate changes, form the matrix in which the earliest
            civilizations evolved. These events, examined in detail with careful attention to brief
            periods or to small areas, probably seem very confused. But organized in terms of the
            whole history of the Quadrant during the Quaternary Age, as we have tried to do, these
            events begin to assume relatively simple patterns. During the Pleistocene period there
            came into existence the triple-layered linguistic and physical pattern that we have
            described. During the Holocene this pattern was somewhat complicated, but the chief
            event was the invention of agriculture, metallurgy, and civilized living by the Highland
            Zone peoples and the subsequent linguistic and cultural submergence of these peoples by
            inflective-speaking longheaded pastoralists pushed in waves from the Flatlands by the
            two postglacial dry periods. One of the chief results of this process, a result seen
            perhaps most clearly in Europe, was to create a political and social structure in which
            patriarchal, warlike, horse-loving, sky-worshiping, honorseeking Indo-Europeans were
            established as a ruling class over peaceful, earth-loving, fertility-dominated,
            femaleoriented peasant peoples. This pattern, first established in central Europe almost
            four thousand years ago, was not destroyed, in spite of Rome, Christianity, and later
            migrations, until the appearance of industrialized urban society in the last four
            generations.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The degree to which civilizations conform to the sevenstage pattern,
            and the
            distortions made in these stages by the matrix in which each civilization is embedded,
            can be seen by examining the historical evolution of various civilizations. In this
            chapter we shall try to do this for the first civilization that ever existed, the one
            founded by the Sumerians in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have pointed out that the peasants of the Neolithic Garden cultures
            practiced
            shifting cultivation, tilling the soil in an area for seven or eight years until the
            fertility of their fields was reduced sufficiently to curtail their crop yields and make
            it advantageous to abandon their huts and move on a short distance to more productive
            fields. In general these peasant peoples followed the hilly edges of the Highland Zone,
            avoiding heavily forested areas or the steeper slopes, and clinging rather to the lower
            valleys, parklands, or loess lands. Although they could cut down forest trees, it was
            easier to use more open areas; above all, it was necessary to settle near water, either
            from springs or from local streams.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Eventually some of these peoples came into the alluvial river valleys,
            including that
            of the Tigris-Euphrates system. Here conditions were quite different from what they were
            on the flanks of the hills above these streams. The annual flood, whose sediment
            replaced the nutritive elements taken from the soil by cropping, made possible, for the
            first time, permanent settlements and thus the foundation of city life and civilized
            living. But the same flood that made the valley fertile made living in it dangerous and
            precarious. It takes an imaginative effort on our part to picture the minds of these
            early peasants who were ignorant of what we take to be self-evident. They had no
            calendars or other methods for keeping track of time; in fact they hardly recognized the
            existence of time as we know it. They knew nothing of the year or of the movements of
            the earth that determine it; they had no knowledge of the causes of the flood and, at
            the beginning, may not even have recognized that it was periodic. Above all, they could
            not have imagined any connection between the movements of the sun and the arrival of the
            flood.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, as can be seen in the archaeological evidence, the flood
            struck
            unexpectedly and brought destruction, death, and fear, along with its fertilizing
            sediment. At Ur, in the lower valley, Sir Leonard Woolley found evidence of human
            residence both below and above a layer of flood deposited clay, from eight to fourteen
            feet thick, laid down by a great prehistoric inundation which had covered about 40,000
            square miles of valley. Sir Leonard believed that this might have been the Deluge of the
            Bible, about 3600 B.C., but this view has not been generally accepted. There is no need
            to accept it, for similar, if perhaps less devastating, floods must have been a frequent
            occurrence in these valleys.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have no knowledge of how the early peasant residents of Mesopotamia
            dealt with this
            problem or with another, similar, one. The excess of water in the valley at one season
            was balanced by a deficiency of water during much of the growing season, so that
            irrigation was almost as urgent as flood control. For projects such as these the early
            peasant peoples lacked both knowledge and capital. No individuals, families, or small
            groups of families could find the economic surplus or the social organization that would
            permit them to construct such projects.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Undoubtedly, for a long time, the peasant inhabitants of the valley
            must have lived a
            precarious life, perhaps keeping their homes on the higher sites that were less
            frequently flooded, while their fields were down in the flood plain itself. But
            eventually, possibly before 5000 B.C., a social organization capable of accumulating an
            economic surplus and able to direct its application to productive projects came into
            existence. The nature of this organization in the prehistoric period must be inferred
            from the evidence available about such an organization in the earliest historic period.
            At that later time, about 3000 B.C., in each city-state of Mesopotamia, the accumulation
            of economic surplus was in the hands of a distinctive social group, the Sumerian
            priesthood; it arose from their control, in the name of the gods they served, of a
            considerable part of the land of the community and of tributes levied, usually in kind,
            upon the produce of lands owned by others. The chief tasks of the priesthoods, at the
            later date, beyond their obvious religious functions, were the study of the stars and
            the keeping of the records of celestial observations.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From this evidence we might infer that, at some remote date, some
            unsung genius or,
            better, some observant family, saw a connection between the advent of the flood and the
            movements of the sun—two events that had not previously seemed connected. This
            individual or family noted that the rising sun appeared at a slightly different point on
            the horizon each morning, finally reaching a limit where it hesitated for a few days
            before it began to return. We would say that the position at which the sun rose moves 47
            degrees of the full circle of the horizon over a period of some 180 days or more. Thus
            was born a rudimentary idea of the solar year, the full duration of the sun\'s movement
            back to its starting point. In time these observers noticed that the flood always came
            about the same number of days after the sun reached its most southern rising point. With
            this information the observer was able to estimate roughly the day on which the flood
            would arrive each year. This calculation the discoverers kept secret, for their own
            profit, using the knowledge to work on the fears and superstitions of their neighbors,
            trying to convince others that they possessed magical powers enabling them to foretell
            the arrival of the flood, or even the power to make it arrive. The original discoverers
            of this information could hardly have told the arrival of the flood within a span of
            time much less than ten days. However, the fear engendered by the flood was so great,
            increased by the realization that the crops would fail if it did not arrive, that some,
            at least, accepted the discoverers\' claims and yielded to their demands for tribute.
            The
            discoverers probably offered to reveal the time of the flood in advance to those who
            would contribute a share of their crops, or perhaps they even threatened to bring the
            flood or to keep it away if they failed to obtain promises of tithes from the crops of
            their neighbors. However skeptical these neighbors might be of such claims the first
            year, no more than one lucky forecast was needed for most of them to become willing
            givers. After all, in such an important matter, it is safer to be on the right side. The
            ignorance of the majority made it easy for the possessors of this specialized knowledge
            to use it as proof that they had supernatural powers. Moreover, it was not necessary to
            convince a majority or even many of the neighbors. If any small number contributed, a
            surplus would accumulate which could be used, in the form of floodprotection embankments
            or irrigation ditches, to provide very concrete evidence that it was worthwhile to
            belong to the new organization. Thus came into existence the central institution of
            ancient Mesopotamia—the Sumerian priesthood.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;This priesthood became a closed group, able to control enormous wealth
            and incomes,
            and concerned very largely with the study of the solar and astronomical periodicities on
            which their influence was orginally based. With the surplus thus created, the priesthood
            was able to command human labor in large amounts and to direct this labor from the
            simple tillage of the peasant peoples to the diversified and specialized activities that
            constitute civilized living. Above all, this centralized direction provided the system
            of flood control and irrigation on which all subsequent progress was founded. Similarly,
            these priest-controlled surpluses provided the capital for the many inventions of the
            age of expansion of Mesopotamian civilization.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Mesopotamian civilization began with a period of mixture, although
            this occurred at
            such an early date that we must, once again, work from inference. We have already
            mentioned the fact that the sexagesimal number system of Mesopotamia in the historic
            period must have arisen from a fusion of a decimal system and a duodecimal system, and
            possibly of a third element based on twenty. The widespread evidence for the very early
            duodecimal system, especially in the diffusion of the practice of dividing into twelve
            parts the wide band of fixed stars through which the sun passes in its annual revolution
            (the zodiac), and the association of this feature with painted pottery gardening would
            indicate that the duodecimal system was a characteristic of the Highland Zone neolithic
            peasant cultures. The decimal usage probably came from the Semite peoples within the
            Fertile Crescent. If a vigesimal system also entered into the mixture, it might have
            come from the south or southeast, for there seem to be, in the substrata of Mesopotamian
            culture, elements of tropical forest origin from this direction. Of course, these
            tropical forest elements, including the use of the dugout canoe and of certain vegetally
            reproduced plants (especially the date palm), may have come into Mesopotamia somewhat
            earlier with the diffusion of those forest-dwelling traits that went to make up the
            European mesolithic cultures. The chief reason for attributing these elements to the
            period of mixture of Mesopotamian civilization is the very powerful one that no
            archaeological evidence for these elements or for any human habitation of the lower
            valley earlier than the Neolithic Garden occupation of the upper valley has been found.
            Yet the fact that Mesopotamia received tropical livestock like fowl and swine about the
            same time that it received the Highland Zone herd animals, as well as the fact that
            neither came from the Semites, makes it necessary to postulate a third element, of
            southern origin, in the Mesopotamian mixture. This element may have come by way of the
            mysterious civilization recently discovered by Danish archaeologists on Bahrein Island.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Additional evidence for early cultural mixture can be found in the
            confusion that
            existed, in the early historic period, between solar and lunar deities. Sometimes the
            sun was regarded as a male god, less frequently as a female goddess; it was usually
            symbolized by a disk or a manypointed sunburst (star). Usually the moon was regarded as
            a female deity, but occasionally it was considered to be male; the usual moon symbol was
            a crescent, but sometimes it seems to have been symbolized as a complete circle (thus
            leading to confusion with the solar disk). This ambivalence of ideas on these two
            heavenly bodies seems to have arisen from a mixture of ideas from neolithic peasant and
            from pastoral Semite sources. It seems evident that early hunting people were
            patriarchal, regarded the male as more important than the female, and similarly
            considered the moon as more significant than the sun. The changes of the moon were more
            easily observed than any changes in the sun\'s position would be to hunting people
            (especially at low latitudes), and the use of the moon, rather than the sun, for hunting
            or fishing made it a much more significant object in their lives. Accordingly, almost
            all early hunting people told time by the moon, and many of them considered it to be a
            male, if not a deity; the sun would obviously be the moon\'s consort, and thus female.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When people passed from a hunting existence to pastoralism without any
            intervening
            stage of peasant agriculture, as the Semites did, these ideas were retained, since moon
            changes were very significant to livestock tenders. It is therefore not surprising that
            the early Semite pastoralists knew the moon as a male deity, sometimes called Sin, and
            knew the sun as a goddess, frequently called Shapash. These ideas, like the Semites
            themselves, came into Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The Highland Garden peoples, as we have indicated, had quite different
            ideas, since
            they regarded the female as more important than the male in economic and social life,
            and had as their chief deity the earth mother goddess. The sun, which was of secondary
            importance to the earth, was male, if it was regarded as a deity at all.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;When the neolithic peasant peoples developed civilizations in the
            alluvial river
            valleys, males became more significant in their social, economic, and political life,
            and the sun became much more significant in their economic activities. In religion this
            served to reduce the earth goddess to a secondary role and make a male solar deity of
            primary significance. But this whole development was much confused by the persistent
            intrusion of Semite religious ideas in which the moon was male and of more importance.
            The rather chaotic ideas on these matters to be found in Mesopotamia in the historic
            period were thus a consequence of cultural mixtures, and not a reflection of incapacity
            to think clearly.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Since the Stage of Gestation is, by definition, a period in which
            nothing sensational
            happens, it is not an easy period to discern in the prehistoric evidence. If we assume
            that the first agriculturalists came into Mesopotamia about 6000 B.C., we might
            postulate a period of mixture for about a thousand years and a period of gestation about
            half as long. In this period a new way of life different from the Neolithic Garden
            culture existed. Sedentary existence for centuries in one area would have reduced game
            and made hunting of little importance. On the other hand, especially in the more humid
            southern valley where there was abundance of grass and reeds, the care of domestic
            animals would have increased in importance. As long as hoe culture continued as the
            normal method of tillage, this probably remained a largely feminine occupation. Thus the
            neolithic society where women generally tilled the soil and men hunted, or did little,
            was superseded by a new culture where men became active contributors to economic life,
            caring for domestic animals. As a consequence dairying became of great significance,
            eventually with powerful religious overtones, and the social superiority of women was
            reduced. This rise in the position of men was increased by the appearance of the
            Sumerian priesthood, which must have been a predominantly masculine organization, since
            idly looking at the heavenly bodies or speculating on the relationships between their
            movements and earthly events is not something busy females would be likely to do. It
            would be much more likely to be found among watchers of herds than among those whose
            eyes are directed downward in daylight hoeing of the soil.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The growth in importance of animal care may also have resulted in
            clearer recognition
            of the male role in reproduction. Where the neolithic culture had regarded women as
            productive, both of crops and of children, the new Mesopotamian culture came to
            recognize the male role in production of both. This, in time, led to a shift in
            religious emphasis from fertility to virility. The symbol of the former had been the
            earth mother, represented by a female figurine, or simple torso, of clay, usually shown
            as pregnant and always shown as excessively female; the symbol of virility now came to
            be symbolized by the bull. This does not mean that the older ideas of fertility and the
            earth mother were abandoned, but that they were supplemented, and, to some extent,
            eclipsed by newer ideas. The earth mother was given a son, who was also her lover, a
            heavenly bull, who was associated with the periodicity of the year and thus with the
            sun. As the sun came and went, and the crops died and were reborn, so this new male god
            of growing things and of life\'s vigor died and was reborn annually. His mother, like
            all
            women, was associated with the moon in a monthly cycle. In time the symbol of the dying
            god became the sun\'s disk, while that of the earth mother became the moon, either as
            circle or as crescent. These two gave rise to a large number of paired symbols that
            together stood for the productiveness of natural processes of birth and decay. The sun
            bull became equivalent to the high-flying eagle or falcon, while the earth cow became
            equivalent to the crescent ship or to the earth\'s intimate, the snake. The life-giving
            subterranean waters of the earth mother were given symbolic fertility by representing
            the dying god as a fish in these waters. Or, by a similar juxtaposition, the swelling
            mound of earth that stood for the productive female principle was made fertile by
            inserting in it a rod, or a pole, a pillar or a tree. In Egypt, where the mound of earth
            became a pyramid, the pillar became an obelisk. The pubic triangle, sharply marked on
            the torso figurines of the earth mother, was made into a more powerful symbol of
            productive force by attaching to the triangle a rod representing the male principle.
            This combination of triangle and rod came to be regarded as an ax symbol, one of the
            most pervasive archaic representations of natural productiveness and power.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;These new religious ideas, in their generalized forms, were widely
            diffused. They
            included the belief that death was an essential preliminary to resurrection, both for
            men and for crops, and the idea that reproduction, of children through sex and of crops
            from planting, were but two aspects of the fruitful relationship of two pervasive
            principles of fertility and virility. The deities associated with these ideas are known,
            in general terms, as the earth mother goddess and the dying god.

            became confused, in character and name, with the pastoral sky god of the Northern
            Flatlands). In Greece and Rome, where Indo-European ideas were powerful, there was
            considerable confusion of these ideas: the sexual aspect became separated from the
            vegetation aspect, one being associated with Aphrodite, or Venus, and her lover, Adonis,
            while the other was associated with Demeter, or Ceres. In Greece the old oriental legend
            of the dying god became the familiar story of Demeter and her daughter Persephone, whose

            that the importance of this priesthood was organizational rather than religious or
            ideological at first. By 4500 this organizational significance was fully established: a
            new, separate group had emerged in Mesopotamian society, and this group was accumulating
            control of wealth beyond its own immediate consumption needs, and using this surplus to
            command the resources of production into capital projects. It is not clear to us how
            this development took place, nor why it occurred at numerous different sites in

            better adapted to the broad flat alluvial plain of Mesopotamia than it was to the narrow
            rocky land of Egypt, especially as the latter\'s transport needs were much more
            adequately served by river traffic, and draft animals were more conveniently available
            to the valley of the Two Rivers.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;It is usually assumed that the earliest wheels must have been solid
            (rather than
            spoked) and were simply cross sections of tree trunks previously used as rollers. This
            is weakened by the fact that large tree trunks were very scarce in Mesopotamia, and the
            earliest representations we have of wheels are spoked. The first of these
            representations is from Level VI at Hassuna, about 4000 B.C., and shows a spoked wheel
            on a piece of pottery. It seems very likely that this was intended to be a symbol of the
            sun rather than a wheel and that the idea of a wheel arose from recognition that sun
            disks, either solid or rayed (spoked), would roll. From a very early period, symbols of
            the gods were displayed as emblems on the walls of temples or were exposed before the
            temples or carried in processions mounted on standards. One of the most common of these
            emblems was the rayed sun disk. Once it was recognized that such disks would roll, it is
            very likely that they were first used as wheels on ceremonial carts kept in the temple,
            as the Juggernaut car was in India. In fact the Juggernaut procession as a necessary
            ceremony for agrarian fertility, ensured by soaking the earth with blood under the
            wheels of a solar car, is closely related to some of the earliest religious ideas of
            Mesopotamia.

            short time it was being used as a war vehicle drawn by more speedy asses or onagers. By
            2500 B.C. priestly tombs at Ur contained four-wheel ox-drawn carts of advanced design.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The surplus controlled by the priesthood had to be stored, and the
            priests themselves
            needed residences and administrative centers for their many activities. In Mesopotamia,
            which lacked both stone and wood, a solution to this problem was found in the invention
            of sun-dried bricks about 5000 B.C. From this came the invention of the arch, the
            construction of temple platforms (ziggurats), and eventually the creation of the debris
            mounds (tells) found throughout southwestern Asia. The arch is a very difficult
            invention, made only once in human history, and accordingly unknown to the Incas or
            Aztecs. Used in Mesopotamia by the fourth millennium, the arch was probably invented in
            the form of the dome, of which it is a cross section. Early Sumerian huts were circular
            in ground plan, constructed of rushes and wicker wands stuck upright in the earth and
            tied together at their upper ends. It would soon be noticed that this structure would
            enclose a wider, more spherical space if a heavy weight were suspended from the center
            of the roof where the wickers came together. In this way the whole shape became less of
            a cone and more of a dome. If an effort were made to face this structure with brick, it
            would soon appear that the weight hanging from the upper center was an essential feature
            of the structure and must be retained in the form of a keystone. The arch itself could
            easily develop from efforts to make a more elongated building from this domelike
            structure, just as happened with Eskimo igloos.

            across Syria and
            Anatolia, and was carried from northwestern Anatolia to northwestern Italy by the
            Etruscans after 1000 B.C. Adopted by the Romans, it was spread by them throughout
            western Europe and back to the Near East to Greece and Egypt, becoming the chief feature
            of ecclesiastical architecture in the medieval period both in Western cathedrals and in
            Byzantine churches. An alternative method for roofing large spaces, by supporting a
            lintel across the tops of columns, is so simple that it has been invented independently
            by every child who has played with blocks in his nursery. This was the method that was
            used regularly by the Egyptians, Minoans, Greeks, and the civilized peoples of America.
            In this structure the distance between columns is determined by the breaking point of
            the lintel under stress from its own weight. This point was so low with the materials
            available to ancient man that any room of normal width had to be supported by rows of
            columns down the middle.

            the summits of
            flat-topped stepped pyramids on mounds, made of mud or clay and faced with sun-dried or
            oven-baked bricks or by pottery jars. These ziggurats, as they were called, are taken as
            evidence for the Highland origin of the Sumerians, since they evidently believed that
            their gods would feel at home on a high spot, and the word \"ziggurat\" meant \"peak\"
            in
            their language. The earliest temple, found at Tepe Gawra in northern Iraq, goes back to
            about 4500 B.C., on a site that was occupied, seven hundred years later, by an elaborate
            ziggurat surmounted by three large temples. Later, more impressive ziggurats were built
            at other places, notably further down the valley at Uruk, Ur, and Babylon. The one at
            Uruk, built about 3200 B.C., was oriented to the four points of the compass and measured
            140 by 150 feet and was 30 feet high. It supported the oldest stone construction in the
            valley and a temple measuring 50 by 65 feet. The most famous of these structures was the
            biblical \"Tower of Babel\" built at Babylon about 2000 B.C. and rebuilt by

            natural nuggets of gold and copper. These materials were so valuable and so soft that
            they could not be used for tools, which continued to be, as previously, of stone.
            Ornaments, however, were made by hammering and later (probably after the discovery of
            smelting from ores) by casting. Soon weapons, probably ceremonial, were made of copper.
            Eventually, possibly by natural contamination, it was found that the addition of a small
            percentage of tin or other metal to copper lowered the melting point and gave a much
            stronger alloy. By 3000 B.C. the correct proportions of tin and copper (one to ten) to
            give strong bronze had been found. As a result the use of bronze for weapons or tools
            spread rapidly, and the use of stone decreased.

            Van. But the rapidly rising standards of living in the river valleys created a demand
            able to suck ores and metal products from great distances into the civilized areas. Thus
            there arose lines of distant trade converging on the Mesopotamian cities. The chief of
            these lines pobably went northward toward Afghanistan, Iran, Armenia, and the Caucasus,
            but these lines have not been explored in any adequate fashion by archaeologists. Other,
            better known, routes, which are of greater significance to our story, went westward

            products great distances. By 2000 B.C., as we have indicated, intermediaries, who were
            originally Semites but were later more mixed in origin, were bringing Spanish copper,
            Irish gold, Cornish tin, Bohemian copper, as well as Danish amber, to both Mesopotamia
            and Egypt. Such distant trade would not have been possible without sailing vessels that

            with incised designs were being used to indicate ownership by impression on clay labels
            in the fifth millennium. The agglutinative character of the Sumerian language probably
            assisted the growth of writing, since symbolic marks could readily come to stand for
            syllables, and its full development was undoubtedly aided by the needs of large-scale
            priestly administration of temple wealth. Since tribute was contributed to the god in
            hope of a favorable flood and good crops, and payment was made for water from the god\'s
            irrigation channels, records had to be kept. Long before 3000 B.C. this was being done
            by scratching on pieces of clay marsh reeds. Soon this was done by stamp seals and later
            still by cylinder seals that could inscribe a continuous record of ownership by being
            rolled across wet clay. Slowly an arbitrary system of symbols came to stand for numbers,
            amounts, and commodities. Later other symbols came to stand for ideas and thus for
            syllables. Such ideographic or syllabic writings were not completely satisfactory
            because ideas and syllables are so numerous that a large number of distinct symbols was
            needed to express even quite simple messages. None of the river-valley civilizations
            ever made the next step to a system of writing in which a small number of symbols
            represented the relatively few basic sounds used in any language. The Egyptians came
            close to this achievement because they did have twenty-four symbols that stood for
            monosyllabic words consisting of a consonant and a vowel, and were used to represent the
            consonant alone. But the Egyptians continued to use hundreds of other symbols for ideas,
            syllables, or words, and thus never acquired the true alphabet. This great achievement,
            as we shall see, was made by the Canaanite civilization in the course of the second
            millennium B.C.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The number system of Mesopotamian civilization, fully worked out by
            2000 B.C., was
            much more efficient than their method of writing. At first they used a system based on
            ten, but by the historic period they had added one based on sixty for scientific work.
            This was much more convenient to use because it eliminated most fractions. The base 10
            is divisible only by itself and 1, 2, and 5; the base 60 is divisible by itself and 1,
            2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, and 30. Fractions were difficult for these archaic peoples
            because they could not conceive of fractions except with numerators of 1; thus 3/4 was
            written as 1/2 plus 1/4.

            positional
            notation, such as we use. In our decimal system each place from right to left represent
            a higher power of ten, the figure in each column indicating how many times that power of
            ten is to be taken. For example, the number 256 represents the sum of 2 times 102, 5
            times 101 and 6 times 100. In the Babylonian system, where each column represented
            similar powers of sixty, the symbol 256 would refer to the sum of 2 times 602, 5 times
            601 and 6 times 600, or 7,506 in our decimal system.

            cumbersome method familiar to us in Roman numerals. With this system calculations
            directly with numbers were not possible and had to be performed by some kind of
            calculating machine such as pebbles in boxes or by the use of the abacus.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;As a result of studies based on religious motives, great progress was
            made in the
            field of astronomy. Originally this interest came from the Sumerian priesthood\'s
            concern
            with the seasons, the solar year, and the date of the flood. It undoubtedly continued
            because of tradition, from a superstitious interest in astrology, and from the hope that
            knowledge of astral behavior would help the priests in controlling the credulous masses
            of the population.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;At no time was the Mesopotamian approach to astronomy scientific in
            our sense, and it
            became less so as time went on. Rather it was empirical. In our scientific approach we
            have an idealized picture of the interrelations of the heavenly bodies, and we try to
            forecast astronomical events by projecting the relationships of the heavenly bodies into
            the future from our knowledge of their present positions and future motions. The
            Mesopotamians made no use of such a picture. Instead they kept accurate records over
            long periods of the occurrence of certain events and tried to forecast future
            occurrences by adding the average period between all past observances of the event to
            the date of the last observation of it. Since each observation gave them one more period
            to use in calculating the average period, their estimates became increasingly accurate
            right to the end of Mesopotamian civilization. This increasing accuracy, for example in
            foretelling eclipses, must not be taken to indicate a continued advance of science,
            since the whole system was empirical rather than scientific.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;But the results are impressive. The work of the late Chaldean
            astronomers, such as
            Naburimanni (alive in 490 B.C.) or Kidinnu (alive in 379), is almost unbelievable.
            Naburimanni gave lists of eclipses of the sun, including ones heknew would not be
            visible in Babylon; he gave the times on which these eclipses would begin, with errors
            of only a few minutes; he gave the positions of the planets far into the future with
            similar small errors. His successor Kidinnu gave the length of the sidereal year as 365
            days 6 hours, 13 minutes, 43.4 seconds, which is only 4 minutes, 32.65 seconds too long.
            He gave the length of the earth\'s movement from its closest distance to the sun, away,
            and back again as 365 days, 6 hours, 25 minutes, 46 seconds—the still accepted figure.
            He gave many other calculations with an accuracy that was not exceeded until the
            nineteenth century or is still accepted today.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In spite of such observations Mesopotamia never achieved a 365-day
            calendar as
            accurate as the Egyptian. All the alluvial civilizations were troubled by efforts to
            combine the old paleolithic month based on changes of the moon with the new agrarian
            year based on movements of the sun. Since the phases of the moon take about 29 1/2 days,
            while the shifts of the sun take approximately 365 1/4 days, it is not possible to fit a
            round number of lunar months into a solar year. Originally both civilizations did this
            by making the year 360 days or 12 lunar months of 30 days each. In such a system, both
            the year and the month were incorrect. The Egyptians remedied the error in the length of
            the year by adding five days which belonged to no month; the Mesopotamians tried to
            remedy the error in the length of the month by alternating months of 29 and 30 days.
            This difference arose because the Egyptian economy was largely agricultural, and thus
            emphasized the sun and the year, while the Mesopotamians were constantly under pressure
            from Semitic pastoral peoples to whom the moon was more important than the sun. As a
            result, the length of the Semitic year came to be only 354 days long, and the seasons
            (which require 365 1/4 days to pass in review) moved slowly through the various months.
            To remedy this a nineteen-year cycle was established in 747 B.C. by inserting seven
            months in every nineteen-year period, just as we insert a day in leap year. The older
            unreformed Babylonian calendar of 354 days was adopted by the Semites, and came through
            the Phoenicians to the Greeks. This chaotic calendar continued to be used at Athens,
            although Democritus learned of the nineteen-year cycle on a visit to Babylon about 448,
            and Meton, in 433, tried to introduce it but could not win Athenian approval. The 354-
            day calendar of Mesopotamia is known to the Arabs to this day.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The attempt to fit the lunar month into the solar year was continued
            until the time of
            Julius Caesar (45 B.C.). The Romans used a modified version of an Anatolian calendar
            which they had obtained from the Etruscans, but they mismanaged it so completely that by
            the time of Caesar the civic year was about three months ahead of the solar year. Caesar
            adopted the Egyptian calendar of 365 1/4 days by inserting two months before March and
            rearranging the number of days in the months as we have them today. This calendar was
            made even more accurate when Pope Gregory XIII provided in 1582 that full century years
            (like 1800, 1900, 2000, and so on) would not be leap years except when they could be
            divided by 400.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The obsession of the archaic civilizations with astronomy and
            calendars had,
            originally, a rational and practical explanation and undoubtedly it was pursued with
            this end in view in the period 5000-2500 B.C. By the third millennium, however, both in
            Mesopotamia and in Egypt, the rate of expansion was beginning to slow down, the priestly
            or royal surpluses were increasingly being used for non-productive purposes, and social
            discontents were rising. These priestly surpluses were controlled by such a small group
            that they could be applied to utilize new and better methods of production only by
            extending the benefits of such increased production to wider and wider circles of
            society. The priestly groups already had more of the necessities of life than they could
            possibly consume, but they were, perhaps unconsciously, reluctant to extend these
            benefits to such a wide group as to make their clique\'s existence meaningless or even
            impossible. Instead of using their surpluses for increased production, which would
            involve a drastic redistribution of the society\'s income, they began to apply this
            income to non-productive purposes. As a result the age of expansion began to draw to its
            close about the middle of the third millennium B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have said that an Age of Expansion shows geographic extension of
            the area of the
            society\'s culture, increase in its population, increase in its economic production,
            growth of factual knowledge, and, probably, certain elements of science and of
            democracy. The existence of all these seems well established in the period of expansion
            of Mesopotamian society. Its area filled the Tigris-Euphrates Valley and pushed up into
            the surrounding highlands and across the Syrian Saddle into the Levant and Anatolia; it
            even spread down the Persian Gulf to its lower shores. The growth of population is
            evident from the great number of tells across the plain and from the debris of thousands
            of residential houses in the ruined strata of these mounds. The rise in production and
            in standards of living is clearly established by the same evidence, while the growth of
            knowledge is recorded in the hundreds of thousands of inscribed clay tablets in these
            ruins. The advance of science has been mentioned already and is beyond doubt, but the
            existence of primitive democratic elements in Sumerian life must be based on inference.
            The arguments to support the existence of democratic influences in the prehistoric
            period have been given by Thorkild Jacobsen of the University of Chicago. They have not
            won universal acceptance by other scholars because of differences of opinion on how much
            democracy is necessary to make a society \"democratic\"; there seems no doubt about the
            existence of democratic elements in the earlier period.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The position held by at least some members of the ruling groups in
            Mesopotamia at the
            very end of the age of expansion can be seen in the famous \"Royal\" graves at Ur about
            2500 B.C. By that time the people believed that their priestly ruler (called ensi) was
            the god\'s representative on earth and that his intercession was necessary to obtain the
            god\'s support for all the orderly periodicities necessary to human life on earth. Since
            they believed in a life after death similar to the life on this earth, these priestly
            leaders were, in some cases, buried with food, furniture, treasures, and even servants
            to assist their life in the hereafter. At Ur the tombs, buried in the earth, were
            full-size rooms constructed of brick and stone, the latter brought from the hills thirty
            miles distant. When the body of the ensi was placed in the tomb, his servants and wives
            were killed at his side, several fourwheeled oxcarts were driven in and the oxen and
            drivers killed, and he was surrounded with rich furnishings. One ensi\'s tomb contained
            the bodies of sixty persons killed with him; another contained the remains of six men
            and sixty-eight women; in another, twenty-five persons were buried with the wife of the
            ensi. Although many of these tombs have been plundered by grave robbers, we possess
            numerous magnificent objects that were left with the dead. Among these were a
            twenty-five-inch model ship made of silver, an elaborate headdress containing more than
            twenty-five feet of gold band, a helmet of sheet gold hammered to resemble locks of hair
            and even individual hairs, numerous cups, vases, and bowls of gold and silver, daggers
            of gold with lapis-lazuli handles, magnificently decorated harps, and many statues of
            animals in precious metals.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have defined the Age of Conflict as extending from the date when the rate of
            expansion begins to decline to the period when one political unit establishes a
            universal empire by conquering the entire area of the civilization. In the earlier part
            of this period the whole core of the civilization may be conquered by one or more
            preliminary empires. In Mesopotamian society we may fix the dates of the Age of Conflict
            from about 2700 B.C. to the Assyrian Conquest about 700 B.C. The preliminary universal
            empires would be found in the Akkadian period about 2350 B.C. and again in the
            Babylonian period about 1700 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We have already listed the chief characteristics of an Age of Conflict to be (1)
            decreasing rate of expansion, (2) imperialist wars, (3) class conflicts, and (4)
            irrationality. These qualities were generally prevalent in the two thousand years that
            we have called Mesopotamia\'s Age of Conflict. Of these the second is most obvious. By
            the latter half of the third millennium, war became the dominant activity of the
            society, and secular military leaders of the armies rose to a social position so high
            that they were able to dominate, without ever completely replacing, the religious
            leaders who had previously dominated the society. War became, in the minds of many
            people, the only way in which adequate supplies of slaves and metals could be obtained
            and by which some compensation could be obtained for the slowing up of economic and
            technical progress. The slowing up of such advance is clearly visible after 2500 B.C.,
            although the dissipation of the priestly surplus gave, for a while, a more equitable
            distribution of the social income and the appearance of a rise in standards of living.
            This slowing up can be seen by comparing the technical advances of the two millennia
            4700-2700 with those of the equally long period 2700-700. In the earlier interval we
            find dozens of significant inventions and discoveries; in the later one we find,
            according to V. Gordon Childe, only two. These two are positional notation of numbers,
            in Babylon, about 2000, and the invention of aqueducts by the Assyrians at the end of
            the eighth century B.C. There were a few other minor advances, chiefly in military
            tactics and governmental administration, but progress, in the old nineteenth century
            meaning of that abused word, never again moved Mesopotamian civilization at such a high
            rate as it did around 3000 B.C.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;Instead of progress, the whole period of 2,000 years was filled with wars. In the
            first part of the period, during the third millennium, these wars were local struggles
            within the river valleys themselves. For the later and longer portion of the period,
            covering most of the second and first millennia B.C., these wars developed into violent
            struggles between civilizations. The chief aim of these later conflicts was to control
            the Syrian Saddle and thus to win, at one stroke, an important source of timber, control
            of the link between the eastern and western areas of civilization, and the right to
            impose tribute—in succession to the Mitanni—on a major part of the commercial activities
            of the Near East. In these struggles the chief contenders were the Egyptian Empire, the
            Hittite Empire in Anatolia, and whatever empire was dominant in Mesopotamia.
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;We say \"whatever empire was dominant in Mesopotamia\" because there was a sequence of
            empires in the valley of the two rivers, roughly corresponding to the sequence of
            dynasties in Egypt. Ultimately the Hittites and Egyptians, who had been struggling
            violently for Syria in the thirteenth century, were both eclipsed, and the final victory
            in the whole Near East, including rule over all these areas, went to the universal
            empire of Mesopotamia. The Hittite civilization was ended by the Iron Age invaders of
            the twelfth century B.C., while Egypt, which had a shorter Age of Conquest but a much
            longer Age of Decay than Mesopotamia, suffered the consequence of this phasing by being
            conquered by Mesopotamian society.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;If we examine the history of Mesopotamia and Egypt from this point of view, we find an
            extraordinary parallel. This parallel was distorted by two, relatively minor,
            differences. Mesopotamia was older than Egypt and thus entered upon its Age of Conflict
            somewhat earlier (2500 B.C., as compared to 2200 B.C.), but, being politically disunited
            and in an exposed geographic position, had a much longer Age of Conflict and a very much
            shorter Age of Decay. Egypt\'s protected geographic position, which allowed it to decay
            without much outside interference for a long time, fell to the Greeks without even a
            token resistance in 334 B.C., while Mesopotamia, which had reached its Age of Universal
            Empire so much later, had only a brief Age of Decay and accordingly still had sufficient
            vitality to put up a vigorous resistance to Alexander\'s invasion before it also
            succumbed in 333 B.C.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In both societies the Age of Conflict was punctuated by the intrusion of pastoral
            intruders, the Hyksos in Egypt and the Kassites in Mesopotamia, both shortly after 1700
            B.C. In Egypt the Hyksos remained a people apart, with their center outside Egypt itself
            (at Avaris in Sinai) and occupying only a portion of the Delta for exploitative
            purposes; they were more easily expelled, about 1567, and Egypt resumed its autonomous
            evolution, achieving its full universal empire in what we call the New Kingdom (1570-
            1166).
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;In Mesopotamia the process was more prolonged. The preliminary core empire of the
            Akkadians (2250-2150) was overthrown to be followed by another Semitic intrusion (the
            Amorites), and a second preliminary core empire of Semitic domination centered at
            Babylon. This latter state, whose best known ruler was the famous Hammurabi (1728-
            1686), was never firmly established, and the intrusion of the Kassites, a generation
            later, broke Mesopotamia up into conflicting political units once more. Only after
            centuries of interminable struggles did a real universal empire emerge under the
            Assyrians. Armed with iron weapons and employing a policy of ruthless militarism,
            peripheral Assyria emerged from the hill country north of the river valley in the ninth
            century B.C. Under Tiglath-Pileser I (1114-1076) and Ashurnasirpal II (883-859) they
            conquered the area between Armenia, the Tigris, and Syria. The methods they used have
            been recorded by Ashurnasirpal himself in the following inscriptions:
        </item>
        <item>Text&#160;&#160;\"I stormed the mountain peaks and took them. In the midst of the mighty mountain I
            slaughtered them, and, with their blood, dyed the mountain red like wool. ... I carried
            off their spoil and their possessions. The heads of their warriors I cut off, and I
            formed them into a pillar over against their city. Their young men and maidens I burned
            in the fire. ... I flayed all the chief men who had revolted and I covered the pillar
            with their skins; some I walled up within the pillar; some I impaled upon the pillar on
            stakes. . . . Many within the border of my own land I flayed, and I spread their skins
            upon the walls, and I cut off the limbs of the royal officers who had rebelled.\"

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;With methods such as these, Assyria conquered most of the Near East and even conquered
            Egypt for a brief period (668-652), but was replaced by Chaldea, a state of Aramean
            Semites, in 612 B.C. Chaldea, in turn, yielded to the last Mesopotamian universal
            empire, Persia, in 538.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;The sequence of universal empires in Mesopotamia helped to keep the society stronger
            than it would otherwise have been. This is equivalent to saying that its period of decay
            was postponed. Each state yielded to its successor because its own instruments of
            governing had become in stitutionalized, but the arrival of new instruments of
            government at the succession of a new state in supreme control served to revitalize the
            society. This was especially true of the last of these universal empires, that of the
            Persians, which assumed control in 538 B.C. and provided a very vigorous government for
            so late in the career of a civilization. By 350, of course, the Stage of Decay had been
            reached, but even then Mesopotamia, unlike Egypt, was not deep in decay, as Egypt was.

        <item>Text&#160;&#160;From these rather cursory remarks it would seem that both Mesopotamian and Egyptian
            civilizations followed the pattern of the seven stages of civilization with only minor
            distortions. The word \"minor\" can, however, hardly be applied to the next civilization
            we wish to examine, that of the Canaanites (2200 B.C-100 B.C.).
